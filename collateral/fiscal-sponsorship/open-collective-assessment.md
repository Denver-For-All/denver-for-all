# Open Collective — Assessment & Implementation Guide

## Why Open Collective

Open Collective with Open Source Collective as fiscal host is the right fit for DenverForAll:

- **Setup in days**, not weeks or months
- **Public real-time ledger** — every dollar in, every dollar out, visible to anyone. This is the strongest trust signal you can offer Denver residents and council members.
- **10% fee** handled by the fiscal host (Open Source Collective)
- **No 501(c)(3) required** — OSC is a 501(c)(6) that handles legal/tax/compliance
- **No gatekeeping** — open to qualifying open-source projects
- **Donations are not tax-deductible** — and that's fine. Your donors are giving $10–50 to support open-source civic research, not looking for tax write-offs.

## What $200–800/Month Funds

| Expense | Monthly Cost | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Claude API tokens | $100–400 | AI-powered policy research, analysis, tool development |

| Hosting upgrades | $0–50 | Database, workers, and storage for civic tools |
| Bilingual translations | $0–100 | Professional Spanish translations of flagship policies |

| **Total** | **$126–765** | |

Every expense is submitted with a receipt and visible on the public ledger.

## Denver Legal Compliance

### Policy Research = Protected Civic Activity

DenverForAll publishes evidence-based policy research and suggests solutions. This is **issue advocacy and civic education**, not political campaigning:

- **Publishing research** (e.g., "rent stabilization would save the average Denver renter $2,400/year") = issue advocacy
- **Suggesting policy solutions** (e.g., "Denver should expand the STAR program to 24/7 coverage") = issue advocacy
- **Sharing research with council members and the mayor's office** = civic participation

### When It Would Become Regulated

- **Issue Committee status** ($500 threshold): Only triggered if you spend money or raise money *specifically to tell people how to vote* on a ballot measure with express advocacy ("Vote YES on Measure X")
- **Lobbyist registration** (DRMC 2-301): Only required for *paid* lobbyists. Volunteers sharing research with public officials fall under the Volunteer Exception.

DenverForAll does neither. Publishing research that others may use to inform ballot measures is not express advocacy — it's the research working as intended.

### Open Collective Strengthens Compliance

The public ledger actually makes compliance easier:
- Every dollar is documented — no risk of undisclosed expenditures
- If anyone questions spending, the full record is already public
- Demonstrates the project is funded by small grassroots donations, not dark money

## Fiscal Host: Open Source Collective

**Why OSC:**
- Purpose-built for open-source projects — DenverForAll's code, research, and tools are all open source and public domain
- 501(c)(6) trade association handling all tax/legal/compliance
- 10% fee on incoming funds
- No application fee, no monthly minimums
- Handles payouts, reimbursements, and tax receipts
- Hosts thousands of open-source projects

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create the Collective (Day 1)

4. Set up the page with mission and what funds support

### Step 2: Apply to Open Source Collective as Fiscal Host (Day 1–3)

1. From your Collective page, apply to Open Source Collective
2. They verify your project is genuinely open source (public GitHub repo, public domain content)
3. Approval typically takes a few days
4. Once approved, you can accept donations immediately

### Step 3: Configure Donation Tiers (Day 3–5)

| Type | Amount | Label |
|------|--------|-------|
| One-time | $10 | Sidewalk Fixer |
| One-time | $25 | Tenant Defender |

### Step 5: Submit Expenses with Receipts

Every expenditure goes through Open Collective with a receipt:
- Anthropic Claude API billing → screenshot/invoice
- Domain renewal → registrar receipt

- Any data subscriptions → provider receipt

OSC reviews and pays/reimburses. Full record is public.

### Step 6: Promote

- Announce on newsletter, Reddit, social channels
- Include donate link in Resistbot campaigns and outreach
- Reference the public ledger in all communications — "see exactly where every dollar goes"
- Mention in outreach to council members and partners — transparency builds credibility
