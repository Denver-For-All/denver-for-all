## The Problem

Denver renters have no protection against arbitrary rent increases. A landlord can raise your rent by $200, $500, or $1,000/month with nothing more than 60 days notice. There is no limit, no justification required, and no recourse.

The result: Denver rents have increased roughly 85% since 2010. The average one-bedroom is over $1,600/month. Families are being priced out of neighborhoods they've lived in for generations. Workers who serve Denver - teachers, nurses, restaurant workers, bus drivers - can't afford to live here.

Colorado state law (CRS § 38-12-301, enacted 1981) prohibits local rent control. Multiple repeal attempts have failed — most recently HB23-1115, which passed the House 40-24 before being killed 4-3 in a Senate committee by a single Democratic defection. Denver must be ready to act the moment preemption is lifted — or pursue a state ballot initiative to repeal it directly.

### What Denver Currently Does

Denver currently has **zero rent stabilization protections**. Colorado Revised Statutes § 38-12-301 preempts all local rent control ordinances. Four repeal attempts have been introduced since 2019 (SB19-225, HB23-1115, and bills in 2024 and 2025 sessions) — all have failed. HB23-1115 came the closest, passing the full House before dying in the Senate Local Government & Housing Committee on April 25, 2023. Governor Polis has publicly opposed rent control, but is term-limited and leaves office January 2027.

Denver rents rose approximately 82-85% between 2010 and 2023 according to Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI) data for the Denver-Aurora-Lakewood MSA and apartment market reports. The average one-bedroom rent in Denver reached approximately $1,600/month by 2024 (ApartmentList National Rent Report, 2024). Denver has roughly 150,000+ rental units (American Community Survey, 2022), and over 50% of Denver residents are renters.

### The State-Level Roadblock

The 1981 preemption (CRS § 38-12-301) is the single biggest legal obstacle to rent stabilization in Denver. Here's the recent legislative history:

| Year | Bill | Outcome |
|------|------|---------|
| 2019 | SB19-225 | Failed in committee |
| 2023 | **HB23-1115** | Passed House 40-24; killed 4-3 in Senate committee (Sen. Dylan Roberts, D-Avon, voted with 3 Republicans) |
| 2024 | Preemption repeal | Did not advance past committee |
| 2025 | No repeal introduced | Session focused on junk fees ban, algorithm rent-setting ban |
| 2026 | TBD | Session underway; no repeal bill identified yet as of February 2026 |

**Key allies:** Rep. Javier Mabrey (D-Denver), Rep. Jennifer Bacon (D-Denver), Sen. Sonya Jaquez Lewis, Sen. Julie Gonzales. **Key obstacle:** Governor Polis (term-limited 2027).

## Our Solution

### The Denver Rent Stabilization Act

**Annual increase cap:** Rent increases limited to the lesser of CPI (Consumer Price Index for Denver-Aurora-Lakewood) or 3% per year. Period.

**No vacancy decontrol.** This is the single most important provision. Most US "rent control" laws allow landlords to reset rent to market rate when a tenant moves out. This creates a perverse incentive to push tenants out. Under our plan, the cap follows the unit, not the tenant. If rent is $1,500 when one tenant leaves, the next tenant's rent starts at $1,500.

**Universal coverage.** Applies to ALL rental units in Denver, regardless of building age, size, or type. No exemptions for new construction (after a 15-year initial window to allow developers to recoup costs), no exemptions for single-unit landlords, no exemptions for luxury units.

**Just cause eviction.** Landlords can only evict for:
- Nonpayment of rent (with 30-day cure period)
- Material lease violation (with cure period)
- Owner move-in (verified, with relocation assistance)
- Building demolition/major renovation (with right of return at same rent + relocation assistance)
- Criminal activity on premises (conviction required, not mere allegation)

**Relocation assistance.** Any no-fault eviction (owner move-in, demolition, renovation) requires the landlord to pay 3 months' rent as relocation assistance.

**Enforcement.** Create a dedicated Rent Stabilization Office within the city, staffed with investigators who respond to tenant complaints, audit landlord filings, and impose penalties for violations. Penalties: $1,000-$10,000 per violation, treble damages to affected tenants.

**Commercial rent stabilization.** Extend protections to small business leases under 3,000 sq ft. Denver's small businesses - restaurants, bodegas, barbershops - are being displaced by the same forces displacing residents.

### International Evidence: This Works

| Country/City | Rent Control Model | Result |
|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Vienna, Austria** | Rent caps on 60% of housing stock. No vacancy decontrol. | Average rent: €5-7/sqm. Virtually no homelessness. Housing is not a financial crisis for any Viennese resident. |
| **Germany (*Mietpreisbremse*)** | New rents cannot exceed 10% above local reference rent (*Mietspiegel*). Annual increases capped at 15-20% over 3 years. | Slowed rent increases in Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich. Challenges remain with enforcement but model is sound. |
| **Sweden (*Hyreslagen*)** | All rents negotiated between tenant unions and landlord associations. No individual rent-setting. | Rents are 40-60% below what market rates would be. Quality remains high. Waitlists exist (demand for affordable housing is infinite). |
| **Netherlands** | Point-based rent system - rent calculated based on unit size, quality, neighborhood. Cannot exceed calculated maximum. | Transparent, objective rent-setting. No landlord discretion. |
| **Paris, France (*Encadrement des loyers*)** | Rent caps based on neighborhood reference rents. | Slowed rapid gentrification in central Paris. |

**The US is the outlier.** Most wealthy democracies regulate rent in some form. The "free market" approach to housing is an American experiment - and it's failed. Cities that rely purely on the market consistently develop housing affordability crises. Cities with strong rent regulation have more stable, affordable housing -- though regulation alone is not sufficient without supply investment.

### Why No Vacancy Decontrol Matters

This is the policy detail that makes or breaks rent control. Here's why:

**With vacancy decontrol** (the weak model):
- Landlord has unit rented at $1,200
- Can only raise rent 3%/year while tenant stays
- Tenant leaves (or is pressured to leave)
- Landlord resets rent to $2,000 market rate
- **Result:** Landlords are incentivized to push tenants out

**Without vacancy decontrol** (our model):
- Landlord has unit rented at $1,200
- Can only raise rent 3%/year
- Tenant leaves
- New tenant's rent starts at $1,200 (or $1,236 with annual increase)
- **Result:** Landlords have zero incentive to push tenants out. Stability.

Every city that has implemented rent control with vacancy decontrol has seen it gutted over time. We won't make that mistake.

## How We Pay For It

Rent stabilization **costs the city almost nothing** to implement. It's a regulation, not a spending program.

- **Rent Stabilization Office:** $3-5M/year for staff, enforcement, and administration
- **Funded by:** Registration fees ($50-100/unit/year) paid by landlords. At 150,000+ rental units in Denver, this generates $7.5-15M/year - more than enough.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Won't rent control reduce housing supply?"**
The Stanford study that rent control opponents love to cite (Diamond et al., 2019) studied San Francisco's rent control *with vacancy decontrol*. Landlords converted rentals to condos to escape the cap. Our plan has no vacancy decontrol - removing that incentive entirely. Additionally, the most comprehensive meta-analyses show that well-designed rent control reduces displacement without reducing supply when paired with construction incentives.

**"Landlords will stop maintaining buildings."**
The act includes habitability enforcement and allows landlords to petition for above-cap increases specifically for capital improvements (new roof, new plumbing, etc.) - but not cosmetic upgrades. This is standard in functioning rent control systems worldwide.

**"This will hurt small landlords."**
A 3% annual increase is sustainable for any competently run rental property. If a landlord's business model requires 8-15% annual rent increases to work, that's not a sustainable business — it's speculation at tenants' expense. For landlords carrying mortgages: mortgage payments are fixed (or adjustable within known parameters), while a 3% annual rent increase compounds year over year. A unit renting at $1,500 today reaches $1,740 in 5 years and $2,015 in 10 years at 3% annual increases — well above typical mortgage payment growth. Landlords who purchased recently at peak prices with high-interest loans face tighter margins, which is why the act allows petitions for above-cap increases tied to documented capital improvements. The registration fee is minimal.

**"The state won't allow it."**
Colorado's rent control preemption is a political choice, not a constitutional one. We push for repeal at the state level while building the local coalition to implement immediately when preemption lifts. If necessary, we pursue a state ballot initiative. Governor Polis, who opposes rent control, is term-limited and leaves office in January 2027 — the political window is opening.

## Our Multi-Track Strategy to Lift the State Ban

The 1981 preemption (CRS § 38-12-301) is the single legal obstacle blocking Denver's Rent Stabilization Act. We're pursuing multiple paths simultaneously:

### Track 1: Denver Trigger Ordinance (2026)
Pass a Denver rent stabilization ordinance that **automatically takes effect** the moment state preemption is repealed. This demonstrates political will, creates a ready framework, and pressures state legislators.

### Track 2: Amended State Bill (2026-2027)
Work with Rep. Mabrey and Rep. Bacon to introduce a strengthened version of HB23-1115 that addresses the specific objections that killed it — mountain town spillover concerns (add population thresholds), development worries (strengthen new construction exemptions), and vacation rental conversion (add anti-conversion provisions).

### Track 3: Statewide Coalition (2026-2027)
Build a multi-city coalition with Boulder, Aurora, Colorado Springs, and mountain towns. A unified statewide demand is harder for the legislature to dismiss than a "Denver issue."

### Track 4: New Governor Window (2027)
Polis is term-limited. A new governor in January 2027 creates the most favorable window for a preemption repeal bill since 1981.

### Track 5: State Ballot Initiative (2028 backup)
If the legislature fails again, Colorado's citizen initiative process lets voters repeal the preemption directly, bypassing both the legislature and the governor.
