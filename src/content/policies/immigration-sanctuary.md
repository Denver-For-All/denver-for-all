## The Problem

ICE enforcement operations in Denver and across Colorado have escalated, terrorizing immigrant communities and destroying families. Undocumented immigrants - who pay taxes, own businesses, and raise American children - live in fear of deportation every day.

Current Denver sanctuary policies have gaps:
- Police still cooperate with ICE in some circumstances
- ICE conducts operations near schools, courthouses, and hospitals
- Undocumented residents avoid reporting crimes, seeking healthcare, and enrolling children in school
- Workers face wage theft and exploitation because employers know they can't complain without risking deportation
- Language access in city services is inconsistent

Denver's Latino community is over 30% of the city population. Our immigrant communities are not an afterthought - they are Denver.

## Our Solution

### The Denver Sanctuary Protection Act

**1. Zero Cooperation with ICE**
- No city employee, department, or contractor may cooperate with ICE in any way
- No sharing of personal information, addresses, work locations, or schedules
- No honoring ICE detainers or warrants (which are administrative, not judicial)
- No allowing ICE to operate in or near city buildings, including jails
- No joint operations between Denver police and ICE
- Violation by any city employee: termination and personal liability

**2. Protected Locations**
- ICE-free zones: schools, hospitals, courthouses, churches, city offices, public transit, shelters
- City will not cooperate with any enforcement action within 1,000 feet of protected locations
- Signs in multiple languages at all protected locations informing community of their rights

**3. Municipal ID Program (Denver ID)**
- Available to ALL Denver residents regardless of immigration status
- Accepted as valid identification for all city services, library cards, and local businesses
- Application process does not require proof of immigration status
- All application data is permanently destroyed after ID issuance - no database for ICE to subpoena
- Encourages participation in civic life, banking, and healthcare

**4. City-Funded Deportation Defense**
- Denver Legal Defense Fund for immigrants facing deportation
- $5M annual allocation for legal representation
- Every Denver resident facing deportation proceedings has access to a city-funded attorney
- Legal know-your-rights workshops in every neighborhood, in multiple languages
- Rapid response network: trained volunteers who respond to ICE raids and document encounters

**5. Wage Enforcement Regardless of Status**
- Denver's wage theft and labor protections apply to all workers, regardless of immigration status
- Workers can file complaints, testify, and receive remedies without fear
- Immigration status is irrelevant in all city enforcement proceedings
- Anti-retaliation: employers who threaten workers with deportation face enhanced penalties

**6. Language Access**
- All city services available in English, Spanish, and the top 5 languages spoken in Denver
- Real-time translation services at all city offices
- Multilingual 311 system
- All public notices, emergency communications, and voting materials in multiple languages
- Bilingual hiring preferences for public-facing city positions

### International Evidence: Inclusion Works

| Country/City | Model | Result |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| **Canada (Toronto, Montreal)** | Sanctuary city policies. Municipal ID programs. Universal healthcare regardless of status. | Immigrant communities report crimes, access healthcare, enroll children in school. Public safety improves when people aren't hiding from government. |
| **Spain** | *Empadronamiento* system - all residents register with municipalities regardless of immigration status, gaining access to healthcare, education, and social services. | Universal access reduces public health costs. Undocumented workers contribute to tax base. Integration outcomes far better than enforcement-focused countries. |
| **Germany** | *Duldung* (toleration) status provides temporary protection and work authorization. Cities provide integration services including language courses and job training. | Integration-focused approach produces better economic outcomes than enforcement. Immigrants contribute to economy within months instead of years. |
| **New York City** | IDNYC municipal ID program (largest in US). Right to counsel in deportation proceedings. Detainer refusal policy. | 1.3M+ IDs issued. Crime reporting by immigrants increased. Deportation defense saves families and keeps communities intact. |

**The evidence is consistent:** cities that include immigrants in civic life are safer, healthier, and more economically productive. Cities that terrorize immigrant communities pay the cost in public health emergencies, unreported crime, and economic exclusion.

## How We Pay For It

- Municipal ID Program: $2M startup, $500K/year operations (offset by $15 ID fee)
- Legal Defense Fund: $5M/year
- Language Access: $3M/year
- Total: ~$10M/year - less than 0.5% of Denver's budget, protecting 30%+ of its population

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Doesn't this encourage illegal immigration?"**
People don't move to Denver because of sanctuary policies. They move for work, family, and safety. Sanctuary policies don't increase immigration - they determine whether immigrant residents live in fear or participate in civic life. When people are afraid to report crimes, everyone is less safe.

**"What about public safety?"**
Study after study shows that sanctuary cities are safer than non-sanctuary cities. When immigrants can report crimes without fear, police get more tips, more cooperation, and more convictions. ICE operations make communities LESS safe by driving people underground.

**"Aren't cities required to cooperate with ICE?"**
No. The 10th Amendment prevents the federal government from commandeering local resources for federal enforcement. Multiple federal courts have confirmed this. Denver has no obligation to do ICE's job.
