## Strategic Framing

Caring for Denver focuses on **mental health and substance misuse**. DenverForAll's strongest alignment is through:
1. **STAR Program expansion advocacy** — Caring for Denver is already the primary STAR funder ($1.5M grant)
2. **Housing stability as mental health intervention** — housing instability is a primary driver of mental health crises
3. **Medical debt as health barrier** — medical debt prevents people from seeking care
4. **Police alternatives research** — evidence base for non-law-enforcement crisis response

The "Alternatives to Jail" funding area is the best fit for our work.

## Application Narrative (Draft)

### Project Title
Denver Crisis Response & Housing Stability Research Platform: Evidence-Based Alternatives to Incarceration

### Organization
Denver For All (under fiscal sponsorship of [Social Good Fund / Movement Strategy Center])

### Project Summary

Denver For All requests funding to expand our evidence-based research platform and civic tools supporting Denver's transition from punitive to therapeutic crisis response. Our platform provides the research infrastructure, public education tools, and community engagement channels needed to build public support for alternatives to jail — including STAR program expansion, mental health crisis response, housing-first approaches, and drug policy reform.

### Statement of Need

Denver's crisis response system relies heavily on law enforcement for situations that are fundamentally health issues:

- **STAR program** has responded to 23,000+ calls since 2022, reducing arrests by 16% overall and 2–3x for people experiencing homelessness (Urban Institute, 2026) — but covers only a fraction of eligible calls
- **9,065 people** experience homelessness on any given night in metro Denver (MDHI, 2024), with mental health and substance use as primary drivers
- **Law enforcement settlements** cost Denver taxpayers $35.3M from 2017–2023 ($17.3M in 2023 alone) — money that could fund therapeutic alternatives
- **Medical debt** prevents people from seeking mental health and substance use treatment; Denver Health still sends patients to collections and places liens on homes
- **Drug criminalization** drives people away from treatment; our drug policy reform proposal documents how treatment-first approaches reduce both substance use and incarceration

### What We've Built

Denver For All has already created the research and civic infrastructure for alternatives to jail:

**Policy Research (directly relevant to Alternatives to Jail):**
- STAR Program Expansion analysis with Urban Institute evaluation data and budget scaling models
- Drug Policy Reform proposal documenting treatment-first evidence from Portugal, Oregon, and international models
- Housing First proposal citing Finland's 35% homelessness reduction — the only EU country with declining rates
- Medical Debt Forgiveness proposal showing $5M can forgive $100–500M in debt (modeled on Toledo, New Orleans, Chicago programs)
- Public Safety proposal with evidence-based alternatives: Phase 1 redirects $25M/year (8% of police budget) to STAR, Co-Responder, and LEAD programs

**Civic Tools:**
- Eviction tracker mapping the intersection of housing instability and crisis — displacement drives emergency system contact
- Tenant rights chatbot providing 24/7 English/Spanish guidance to prevent housing crises before they escalate
- Campaign finance tracker showing how law enforcement union and real estate PAC spending shapes policy priorities

### Proposed Activities with Caring for Denver Funding

**Activity 1: Expanded STAR & Crisis Response Research ($80,000–150,000)**
- Deep analysis of STAR call data to identify expansion opportunities and service gaps
- Cost-benefit modeling for STAR coverage in all Denver neighborhoods
- Comparative research on crisis response models (CAHOOTS/Eugene, LEAD/Seattle, Crisis Now/Arizona)
- Public-facing research dashboards showing STAR outcomes by neighborhood

**Activity 2: Housing-as-Health-Intervention Research & Tools ($60,000–120,000)**
- Expanded eviction tracker with mental health and crisis system cross-referencing
- Research on housing instability as a predictor of emergency department utilization, psychiatric hospitalization, and incarceration
- Housing First cost-benefit analysis specific to Denver's population and service costs
- Community-facing tools showing the health cost of displacement

**Activity 3: Community Education & Engagement ($40,000–80,000)**
- Professional Spanish translation of all mental health, substance use, housing, and crisis response policy research
- Community education campaigns on alternatives to jail through grassroots channels (600+ weekly visitors, social media, Resistbot)
- Shareable one-pagers on STAR expansion, housing first, drug policy reform, and medical debt forgiveness
