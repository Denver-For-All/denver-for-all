## The Problem

Denver's arts and culture sector generates $3.12 billion in annual economic activity, sustains 14,466 jobs, and draws nearly three times more attendance than all of Denver's professional sports teams combined (CBCA Economic Activity Study, 2024). Yet the artists who built Denver's cultural identity are being systematically displaced by the very development their creativity attracted. A 2020 study ranked Denver the second-most gentrified city in the United States, and the neighborhoods most affected -- RiNo, Santa Fe Arts District, Five Points -- are the same ones that defined Denver's arts scene for decades.

In RiNo, artists coined the neighborhood's name and founded the RiNo Art District in 2005, transforming forgotten warehouses into studios, galleries, and performance spaces. The reward for that work was soaring property values, skyrocketing rents, and displacement. Rhinoceropolis, a beloved DIY music and art collective on Brighton Boulevard, was shuttered by fire inspectors in December 2016, displacing eleven artists. Helikon Gallery & Studios was forced out. On Santa Fe Drive, the Chicano Humanities & Arts Council was priced out of its longtime home. On South Broadway, 3 Kings Tavern -- a 14-year staple of Denver's live music community -- permanently closed in 2020. The pattern repeats: artists create cultural value, developers capture it, and the artists are pushed to Globeville, to the suburbs, or out of Colorado entirely.

Meanwhile, Colorado ranks 39th out of 50 states in per capita arts funding, despite having the fourth-largest cultural sector as a proportion of state GDP (Colorado Creative Industries, 2024). Denver ranks 18th on the national Arts Vibrancy Index, behind peer cities Nashville (7th), Austin (10th), Seattle (13th), and Portland (17th) (SMU DataArts, 2024). Commercial studio rents in Denver average $29 to $39 per square foot, putting dedicated creative workspace out of reach for most independent artists. The city has strong cultural institutions and a passionate creative community. What it lacks is a policy framework that protects that community from the market forces destroying it.

### What Denver Currently Does

**Denver Arts & Venues (DAV)** is the city agency responsible for cultural programs and major venues including Red Rocks Amphitheatre, the Denver Performing Arts Complex, and the Denver Coliseum. DAV's 2024 budget was $67.6 million, but this is largely self-funded through venue revenue, not the general fund (Denver Mayor's Budget, 2024). DAV launched the **Denver Creates** cultural plan in 2024, a ten-year roadmap built on 2,500+ community voices, with commitments to arts amplification, youth engagement, and a downtown arts marketplace. In 2025-2026, DAV provided $633,270 in grants to 62 organizations through the Denver Creates Fund.

**The Scientific and Cultural Facilities District (SCFD)** is a 0.1% regional sales tax across seven Denver-area counties, created by voters in 1988 and reauthorized three times (next renewal: 2028). SCFD distributed $85 million in 2024 to over 300 nonprofit cultural organizations. However, the funding is heavily weighted toward large institutions: Tier I organizations (Denver Zoo, Denver Art Museum, Denver Museum of Nature & Science, Denver Botanic Gardens, Denver Center for the Performing Arts) receive 65.5% of revenue, or roughly $50.3 million. Tier III, which covers the 280+ small local organizations -- community theaters, art centers, cultural groups -- receives just 13.5%.

**Denver's Public Art Program**, established by executive order in 1988 and codified by ordinance in 1991 (DRMC 20-85), allocates 1% of any city capital improvement project over $1 million to public art. The program has generated over $40 million and installed more than 400 works, with 55% created by Colorado artists (Denver Public Art, 2023). However, this applies only to city capital projects, not private development.

**P.S. You Are Here (PSYAH)** is a DAV grant program launched in 2014 that supports neighborhood-based, community-led public art projects in outdoor spaces. Since inception, it has provided over $600,000 to fund 71 projects, with approximately $67,500 per year in recent cycles. Denver has no formal cultural district zoning designations and no Agent of Change policy protecting existing music venues from noise complaints by new residential development.

## Our Solution

### 1. Artist Anti-Displacement

- Develop affordable artist live/work spaces in city-owned or city-subsidized buildings, with rents capped at 30% of area median income for artists. Integrate artist housing into the city's social housing program so that creative workers benefit from the same protections as other residents.
- Enact zoning protections for existing artist studios and live music venues. Adopt an **Agent of Change policy**: when new residential development is built near an existing music venue or performance space, the developer -- not the venue -- bears responsibility for sound insulation and noise mitigation.
- Establish right of first refusal for artist tenants when buildings containing studios, galleries, or performance spaces are sold or converted to other uses.
- Create an artist relocation assistance fund providing emergency grants to artists and small cultural organizations displaced by rent increases or building conversions.
- Artists and cultural workers benefit directly from our rent stabilization and social housing proposals. Arts policy and housing policy are inseparable in a city experiencing Denver's level of displacement.

### 2. Expanded Percent-for-Art

- Extend Denver's percent-for-art requirement to **private development**: 1.5% of all private development projects over $1 million allocated to public art. Denver's current 1% ordinance applies only to city capital projects. Expanding to private development aligns Denver with cities like San Diego, Seattle, and Portland that require developer contributions to public art.
- Establish neighborhood advisory committees with community input on public art selection, ensuring art reflects the culture and history of the neighborhood where it is installed.
- Prioritize local Denver and Colorado artists for commissions, building on the existing program's 55% local artist track record and raising the target to 70%.
- Expand the definition of eligible art to include performing arts, murals, music installations, and digital art -- not just sculptures and static visual pieces.
- Create a dedicated maintenance fund for existing public art, ensuring the city's 400+ piece collection is preserved and accessible.

### 3. Affordable Creative Spaces

- Convert underutilized city-owned buildings into below-market studios, rehearsal spaces, galleries, and maker spaces. Denver's office vacancy rate exceeds 29% (CommercialCafe, 2024) -- there is no shortage of available space, only a shortage of political will to repurpose it.
- Require creative space set-asides in new mixed-use developments over 50,000 square feet: a minimum of 5% of commercial square footage designated for below-market creative use.
- Partner with nonprofits like RedLine Contemporary Art Center and community land trusts to manage shared creative spaces with long-term affordability covenants.
- Fund shared equipment access: recording studios, printmaking presses, digital fabrication labs, ceramics kilns, and darkrooms available to Denver artists at subsidized rates.
- Study and adapt successful models: Los Angeles Arts District BID's creative space requirements, New York City's artist certification program for live/work lofts, and Colorado Springs' Artspace affordable housing project for creatives.

### 4. Cultural District Protections

- Establish formal **cultural district designations** for Santa Fe Arts District, RiNo, Five Points/Welton Corridor, and Globeville-Elyria-Swansea. Colorado Creative Industries has certified 30 creative districts statewide since 2012; Denver's most culturally significant neighborhoods deserve explicit city-level protections beyond state certification.
- Implement special zoning within cultural districts: entertainment and cultural uses protected as a right, not a conditional use. Noise complaint procedures adjusted so that established venues are not penalized for activity that preceded residential development.
- Offer property tax incentives for property owners within cultural districts who lease commercial space to cultural businesses -- galleries, studios, music venues, theaters, bookstores -- at below-market rates.
- Require **cultural impact assessments** for any major development project within a designated cultural district, evaluating the project's effect on existing artists, cultural organizations, and community character before approval.
- Codify an **Agent of Change policy**: new residential development within 200 meters of an existing music venue, theater, or performance space must include sound insulation meeting specified acoustic standards. The developer, not the venue, pays.

### 5. Creative Economy Investment

- Establish a city grants program for emerging artists and small cultural organizations, separate from the SCFD system. SCFD's Tier III provides just 13.5% of its $85 million to small local groups. Denver needs a complementary program targeting independent artists, DIY spaces, and grassroots cultural organizations that fall outside SCFD eligibility.
- Fund creative industry workforce development: apprenticeships in technical theater, sound engineering, arts administration, and digital media production. Partner with community colleges and trade programs.
- Invest in marketing support for Denver's cultural tourism, which already generates $692 million annually (CBCA, 2024). Every dollar spent promoting Denver's arts scene has measurable economic returns.
- Streamline and reduce the cost of city permits for cultural events, street performances, pop-up galleries, and outdoor festivals. Eliminate permit fees for small-scale cultural events organized by nonprofit or community groups.
- Establish a creative economy data tracking program to measure the sector's contributions to employment, tax revenue, tourism, and neighborhood vitality, ensuring policy decisions are evidence-based.

### International Evidence: Culture Drives Cities

| Country/City | Model | Result |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| **Berlin, Germany** | Atelierprogramm (Studio Programme): city government funds nearly 800 subsidized studios with fixed rents for professional artists, administered by the bbk Berlin Kulturwerk. Minimum exhibition fees established for municipal galleries. | Artists retained in the city despite gentrification pressure. Programme expanded repeatedly by the Berlin Senate. Created an infrastructure for professional artists described as "unique in Europe." |
| **Austin, TX** | Live Music Fund (est. 2019) funded by hotel occupancy taxes. Live Music Venue Preservation Fund provided $5M in direct grants to 28 venues during COVID. Agent of Change principles in development code. | $7M+ earmarked annually for live music. Venues survived the pandemic. Austin maintained its identity as the "Live Music Capital of the World" through deliberate policy, not accident. |
| **Barcelona, Spain** | Cultural rights enshrined as fundamental rights. Fabra i Coats cotton factory converted to a municipal Creation Factory with 2,450 sqm of exhibition space, artist residences, and 46 units of social housing for young people and artists. Network of "creation factories" across the city. | Former industrial infrastructure transformed into cultural commons. Artists and communities integrated into city planning. Social housing combined with cultural production in a single facility. |
| **Medellin, Colombia** | Parque Biblioteca (Library Park) system: world-class cultural centers built in the city's most underserved neighborhoods. Community designed alongside architects. Integrated with MetroCable transit connecting hillside communities to cultural and economic centers. | Five initial library parks, five more added, serving 784,000 residents. Cultural infrastructure placed where people live, not just downtown. Transformed neighborhoods marked by decades of violence into centers of learning and creative expression. |
| **Melbourne, Australia** | Creative Spaces programme providing long-term affordable studios. Flash Forward laneway activation commissioned 150+ artists to transform 40 city laneways. Shopfront Activation Program (AUD $2.6M) placed creatives in vacant storefronts. | Estimated AUD $38.34M economic contribution from laneway activation alone. Many pop-up creative tenants converted to long-term leases. Melbourne maintained its identity as a city of cultural production, not just consumption. |

Denver's arts scene is not a luxury -- it is an economic engine. The metro Denver cultural sector generates $3.12 billion in economic activity, employs over 14,000 people, draws 14.52 million in-person attendances annually, and drives $692 million in cultural tourism. Colorado ranks first in the nation in per capita arts participation (National Endowment for the Arts). The cities that thrive in the 21st century are the ones that invest in culture as infrastructure, not an afterthought. Denver has the raw ingredients. What it needs is the policy framework to protect and grow them.

## How We Pay For It

- **Artist housing:** Integrated into the social housing program. $0 additional cost if artist live/work units are included in housing bond allocations already proposed.
- **Percent-for-art expansion to private development:** $0 city cost. This is developer-funded. A 1.5% allocation on a $50 million project is $750,000 -- a marginal cost that produces lasting public benefit.
- **Affordable creative spaces:** $5-8M/year for conversion and management of city-owned buildings, with rental income partially offsetting operating costs. Equipment-sharing programs funded through a mix of city grants and earned revenue.
- **Cultural district designations:** $0 direct cost. These are regulatory tools -- zoning changes and impact assessment requirements that cost nothing to implement.
- **Creative economy grants and workforce development:** $3-5M/year, funded through a combination of general fund allocation and a dedicated share of hotel/lodging tax revenue (cultural tourism generates $692M -- reinvesting a fraction is common sense).
- **Total new city investment: $8-13M/year**, with significant economic returns. Denver's cultural sector generates $3.12 billion in economic activity. An $8-13M annual investment represents less than half of one percent of the sector's economic output and would be repaid many times over in retained cultural tourism, job creation, and neighborhood stabilization.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Art is a luxury, not a city priority."**
Denver's cultural sector generates $3.12 billion in economic activity, employs 14,466 people, and drives $692 million in cultural tourism annually (CBCA, 2024). Cultural attendance in metro Denver -- 14.52 million -- is three times the combined attendance of the Rockies, Broncos, Nuggets, Avalanche, and Rapids (4.9 million). No one calls professional sports a luxury. Arts and culture is a larger economic force in Denver than professional sports, and it deserves at least comparable policy attention.

**"Percent-for-art increases development costs."**
The proposal is 1.5% of project costs above $1 million. On a $10 million project, that is $150,000 -- a fraction of the marketing budget for most developments. Cities including San Diego, Seattle, and Portland have private-development percent-for-art requirements and have not seen meaningful impacts on development activity. Public art increases property values in surrounding areas, directly benefiting the developer.

**"Why should the city protect music venues?"**
The Agent of Change principle, now enshrined in UK planning law (2025) and adopted in cities across Australia, places responsibility for noise mitigation on whoever changes the environment. When a developer builds apartments next to a venue that has operated for years, the developer -- not the venue -- should bear the cost of soundproofing. Without this protection, venues that anchor entire cultural districts get shut down by noise complaints from new residents who moved in after the venue was established. Denver has already lost Rhinoceropolis, 3 Kings Tavern, Syntax Physic Opera, and others. This is preventable.

**"RiNo is already an arts district."**
RiNo was an arts district. Artists named it, built it, and gave it cultural identity. Then rents exploded, property taxes soared, and most of the artists who created RiNo were priced out. As one observer noted, "the creatives are moving across into Globeville" -- repeating the same cycle of displacement. A name on a sign is not protection. Formal cultural district designation with zoning protections, tax incentives for cultural tenants, and cultural impact assessments would give artists actual tools to remain in the neighborhoods they built.

**"Denver already has SCFD."**
SCFD is a critical funding source -- $85 million in 2024 -- but it primarily funds large institutions. Tier I organizations (the Zoo, Art Museum, Museum of Nature & Science, Botanic Gardens, DCPA) receive 65.5% of the total. Tier III, which supports the 280+ small local cultural organizations, receives just 13.5%. Independent artists, DIY venues, and grassroots cultural groups -- the backbone of neighborhood-level arts culture -- often fall outside SCFD eligibility entirely. This proposal addresses the gap between what SCFD funds and what Denver's creative community actually needs.
