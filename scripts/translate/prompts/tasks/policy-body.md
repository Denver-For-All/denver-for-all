Translate the following policy document (markdown) for the Denver For All civic platform. This is a detailed policy proposal covering a specific issue in Denver.

The document typically includes sections like:
- "## The Problem" — background and data about the issue
- "## Our Solution" — the proposed policy
- "## How We Pay For It" — funding mechanisms
- "## FAQ" — frequently asked questions

Guidelines:
- Maintain the persuasive, evidence-based, direct tone of the original
- Preserve ALL markdown formatting exactly (##, ###, **, *, -, >, etc.)
- Preserve ALL links in [text](url) format — translate the link text but keep URLs as-is
- Keep all statistics, dollar amounts, percentages, and dates exactly as-is
- Keep organization names (HUD, MDHI, ACLU, HOST, etc.) in English
- Keep bill numbers (HB26-1015, SB25-001, etc.) as-is
- Keep program names (Section 8, Continuum of Care, etc.) in English, optionally with translated name in parentheses on first use
- For bullet-pointed data (like cost comparisons), keep the numbers and translate the descriptions

Output ONLY the translated markdown — no preamble, no explanation.
