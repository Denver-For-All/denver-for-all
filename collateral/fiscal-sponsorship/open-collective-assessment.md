# Open Collective — Assessment & Implementation Guide

## Why Open Collective Over Traditional Fiscal Sponsors

| Factor | Social Good Fund | Movement Strategy Center | Open Collective + OSC |
|--------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Setup time** | ~1 month | Seasonal cohorts (months) | Days |
| **Fee** | 8% + $29/mo | ~10–15% | 10% (Open Source Collective) |
| **Transparency** | Standard nonprofit reporting | Standard | Public real-time ledger of every transaction |
| **Tax-deductible donations?** | Yes (501(c)(3)) | Yes (501(c)(3)) | No (OSC is 501(c)(6)) |
| **Foundation grants?** | Yes | Yes | No (most require 501(c)(3)) |
| **Acceptance rate** | ~10% | Cohort-based | Open to qualifying open-source projects |
| **Cultural fit** | Nonprofit world | Movement orgs | Open-source, civic tech, transparency |
| **Donor experience** | ActBlue/Givebutter | ActBlue/Givebutter | Embedded widget, credit card, one-time or recurring |
| **Public accountability** | Annual reports | Annual reports | Every dollar in, every dollar out, visible to anyone |

**Bottom line:** Open Collective sacrifices tax-deductibility and foundation grant eligibility in exchange for speed, radical transparency, and cultural alignment with an open-source civic tech project. For DenverForAll's needs ($200–800/month to fund research), small-dollar grassroots donations through Open Collective are more than sufficient.

## Grant Funding Impact

**What you lose:**
- Eligibility for most foundation grants (Denver Foundation, Caring for Denver, Fund for Housing & Opportunity, Colorado Health Foundation) — these require 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsors
- Tax-deductible status for donors (donors can't write off contributions)

**What you keep:**
- Federal grant templates are unaffected — those are designed for the City of Denver to file, not DenverForAll
- Partnership opportunities (Undue Medical Debt, ILSR, Local Progress) don't require 501(c)(3)
- Outreach to elected officials, the governor's office, and senators is unaffected

**Why this tradeoff works:**
- Your operating costs are under $840/year currently
- At $200–800/month from small donors, you'd have $2,400–9,600/year — 3x to 11x your current budget
- The radical transparency of a public ledger is a stronger trust signal for grassroots donors than tax-deductibility
- You can always add 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsorship later if a major grant opportunity arises — Open Collective doesn't lock you out

**If you ever want grants back:** You can maintain an Open Collective for grassroots donations AND separately apply for 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsorship for specific grant applications. They're not mutually exclusive.

## Fiscal Host: Open Source Collective

**Why Open Source Collective (OSC):**
- Purpose-built for open-source projects — DenverForAll's code, research, and tools are all open source
- 501(c)(6) trade association — handles all tax/legal/compliance
- 10% fee on incoming funds (industry standard)
- No application fee, no monthly minimums
- Handles payouts, reimbursements, and tax receipts
- Already hosts thousands of open-source projects

**Alternative host — Social Change Nest:**
- Hosts grassroots and social change projects
- May be a better narrative fit if you want to emphasize the advocacy/community angle over the open-source angle
- Similar fee structure

**Recommendation:** Start with Open Source Collective. Your project is literally open-source civic technology — it's the most natural fit and the fastest path.

## Denver Legal Compliance

### Policy Research vs. Ballot Issues

DenverForAll's work is **issue advocacy and civic education**, not political campaigning:

- **Publishing evidence-based policy research** = protected civic activity
- **Suggesting policy solutions** (e.g., "Denver should build municipal broadband") = issue advocacy, not express advocacy for/against a candidate or ballot measure
- **Sharing research with council members and the mayor's office** = civic participation

**When it becomes regulated:**
- If DenverForAll spends money or raises money **specifically to tell people how to vote** on a ballot measure, it triggers "Issue Committee" status under Denver's campaign finance rules ($500 threshold)
- Publishing research that others use to create ballot measures does NOT trigger this — only express advocacy does

### Lobbying

Denver Municipal Code (DRMC 2-301) requires registration for **professional lobbyists** — people paid to influence officials. DenverForAll falls under the **Volunteer Exception**:
- All development and advocacy work is volunteer
- Sharing research with public officials is a protected civic activity
- No paid lobbyists, no registration required

### Open Collective and Compliance

Open Collective's public ledger actually strengthens compliance:
- Every dollar in and out is documented publicly
- If questions about spending arise, the full record is already transparent
- No risk of undisclosed expenditures

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create the Collective (Day 1)

1. Go to opencollective.com and create a new Collective
2. **Name:** "Denver For All" (or "Denver Policy Research Collective" if you want to emphasize the research angle)
3. Add description, logo, and link to denverforall.org
4. Set up the page with your mission, what funds support, and transparency commitments

### Step 2: Apply to Open Source Collective as Fiscal Host (Day 1–3)

1. From your Collective page, apply to Open Source Collective as your fiscal host
2. They'll review that your project is genuinely open source (it is — public GitHub repo, public domain content)
3. Approval typically takes a few days
4. Once approved, your Collective can accept donations immediately

### Step 3: Configure Donation Tiers (Day 3–5)

Set up contribution tiers matching the donation copy already written:

| Tier | Amount | Label |
|------|--------|-------|
| One-time | $10 | Sidewalk Fixer |
| One-time | $25 | Tenant Defender |
| One-time | $50 | Policy Builder |
| One-time | $100 | Democracy Maker |
| Monthly | $10/mo | Keep the Lights On |
| Monthly | $25/mo | Research Sustainer |
| Monthly | $50/mo | Core Supporter |
| Custom | Any | Every dollar counts |

### Step 4: Add Transparency Page to DenverForAll.org

Embed the Open Collective widget and add the transparency statement (see below).

### Step 5: Submit Expenses with Receipts

Every expenditure gets submitted through Open Collective with a receipt:
- Claude API tokens → screenshot of Anthropic billing
- Domain renewal → registrar receipt
- vAPI chatbot → monthly invoice
- Any hosting upgrades → provider receipt

The fiscal host (OSC) reviews and pays/reimburses. The full record is public.

### Step 6: Promote

- Add donate button/widget to every page on DenverForAll.org
- Announce on newsletter, Reddit, social channels
- Include in Resistbot campaigns and outreach materials
- Reference the public ledger in all communications — it's your strongest trust signal
