## The Problem

Denver's current "affordable housing" is temporary. Tax credit projects expire after 15-30 years and revert to market rate. Down payment assistance doesn't prevent future displacement when neighborhoods gentrify and taxes rise. The affordable housing we build today disappears tomorrow.

We need permanently affordable housing controlled by the community, not by developers or the market.

### What Denver Currently Does

Denver already has a community land trust: **Elevation Community Land Trust** (formerly Colorado Community Land Trust), which has operated since 2003. Elevation CLT currently holds approximately 300 permanently affordable homes in the Denver metro area. Denver's Department of Housing Stability (HOST) has provided some funding for Elevation CLT acquisitions.

However, the scale is far below what is needed. Elevation CLT adds approximately 20-40 homes per year. At that rate, it would take over 50 years to reach our 2,500-unit target. Our proposal dramatically scales what already works by providing dedicated city funding, connecting CLTs to the vacancy tax revenue stream, and integrating CLTs with the corporate landlord divestiture pipeline.

## Our Solution

### Denver Community Land Trust Initiative

**City-seeded CLTs:** Denver funds 5 Community Land Trusts - one for each geographic region of the city - with $10M each in startup capital ($50M total).

**How CLTs work:**
1. The CLT owns the land. Permanently.
2. Homeowners buy (or rent) the building on the land.
3. When they sell, resale prices are limited by formula - typically allowing the owner to recoup their investment + equity from improvements + a modest appreciation share (e.g., 25% of market appreciation).
4. The next buyer gets the home at an affordable price. Forever.

**Governance:** Each CLT is governed by a tripartite board:
- 1/3 CLT residents
- 1/3 community members (non-resident neighbors)
- 1/3 public representatives (city appointees with housing expertise)

**Acquisition strategy:**
- Right of first purchase when properties in anti-displacement zones are listed for sale
- Acquire properties from corporate landlord divestiture (see: Corporate Landlord Ban)
- Partner with Social Housing Authority for multi-family buildings
- Accept donated properties with tax benefits for donors

**Target:** 2,500 permanently affordable homes within CLTs over 10 years.

### International Evidence: Community Land Ownership Works

| CLT/Country | Model | Result |
|------------|-------|--------|
| **Champlain Housing Trust (Burlington, VT)** | Largest CLT in US. 2,800+ homes since 1984. | Foreclosure rates **10x lower** than conventional mortgages. Homes remain affordable across generations. Model for the movement. |
| **London CLT (UK)** | Community-led development on public land. First homes delivered in 2017. | Permanently affordable homes in one of the most expensive cities on Earth. Prices locked to local incomes, not the property market. |
| **Brussels CLT (Belgium)** | Government-supported CLT producing affordable housing since 2012. | Tripartite governance model. Housing affordable to families earning 30-60% of median income. Growing rapidly. |
| **Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative (Boston)** | Community-organized CLT in historically redlined neighborhood. Used eminent domain to acquire vacant land. | Prevented gentrification. Built 225+ affordable homes. Community controls its own land. National model for anti-displacement. |
| **Kenya** | Community Land Act (2016) formalized communal land tenure. | Protects community land rights from speculative acquisition. Different context but same principle: land held in trust for community benefit. |

**The CLT model has been proven over 50+ years, across multiple countries and continents, at every scale.** It works because it separates the value of the home (which the owner keeps) from the value of the land (which the community holds). This removes speculation while preserving genuine homeownership.

## How We Pay For It

- **Startup capital:** $50M from city bonds, federal HOME program funds, and vacancy tax revenue
- **Ongoing:** CLTs are self-sustaining once established - ground lease fees cover operations
- **Acquisition:** Funded by vacancy tax revenue, corporate landlord divestiture proceeds, and federal grants

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Do CLTs actually work?"**
Champlain Housing Trust in Burlington, VT has operated since 1984 with over 2,800 homes. Foreclosure rates are 10x lower than conventional mortgages. Homes stay affordable across generations. It works.

**"Is this really homeownership if you can't keep all the profit?"**
You own your home. You build equity. You just can't speculate on the land underneath it. The trade-off: you paid an affordable price going in. The next family deserves the same opportunity. This is homeownership for people who want homes, not for people who want investment vehicles.
