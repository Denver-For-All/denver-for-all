## The Problem

### Rocky Flats & Radioactive Contamination
The Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant operated 16 miles from downtown Denver from 1952-1992, producing plutonium triggers for nuclear warheads. Multiple fires, leaks, and intentional releases contaminated soil and groundwater with plutonium, americium, uranium, and other radioactive materials.

The "cleanup" was completed in 2005 and the site was converted to a wildlife refuge and opened to the public. Independent soil sampling - including samples from areas above Beaver Brook Reservoir and throughout the Front Range foothills - has found elevated levels of radioactive isotopes and heavy metals, including lead, above safety thresholds.

Denver's water supply and the health of residents downwind and downstream of Rocky Flats remain at risk. The federal government has declared the cleanup "complete." It is not.

### Lead Contamination
Independent soil sampling throughout the Front Range has found elevated lead levels - in residential areas, near waterways, and above reservoir watersheds. Dam maintenance and construction projects in the area have been impacted by contamination concerns. This is a public health emergency that receives almost no attention.

### Climate Change
Denver's air quality regularly exceeds EPA limits. Urban heat islands make low-income neighborhoods 10-15°F hotter than wealthy areas with tree cover. Wildfire smoke increasingly blankets the metro area. Water supply faces long-term threats from reduced snowpack.

## Our Solution

### 1. Rocky Flats Independent Investigation
- City-funded independent environmental assessment of Rocky Flats contamination pathways - not relying on DOE's self-assessment
- Comprehensive soil, water, and air sampling in Denver and the downwind/downstream corridor
- Public health study of cancer rates in affected communities
- Legal action against the federal government if contamination exceeds safe levels
- Demand: No public access to Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge until independent assessment confirms safety
- Community health screenings for residents in affected areas

### 2. Front Range Lead Remediation
- Comprehensive soil testing program - free testing for any Denver resident's yard
- Remediation of contaminated public lands and waterways
- Childhood lead screening mandate for all Denver children
- Drinking water testing and lead pipe replacement (complete within 5 years)
- Dam and reservoir contamination assessment with public reporting

### 3. 100% Renewable City Operations by 2030
- All city buildings, vehicles, and operations powered by renewable energy
- City fleet fully electric by 2030
- Solar on every city-owned building
- City divests pension funds from fossil fuels
- Green building standards for all new construction (commercial and residential)

### 4. Environmental Justice Zones
- Designate frontline communities (Globeville, Elyria-Swansea, Montbello, Sun Valley) as Environmental Justice Zones
- No new polluting facilities within or adjacent to EJ Zones
- Accelerated cleanup of existing contamination
- Air quality monitoring network with public real-time data
- Health impact assessments required for any development in EJ Zones
- Green infrastructure investment: tree canopy, parks, urban farms

### 5. Urban Climate Resilience
- Urban tree canopy expansion: 30% coverage citywide (currently ~20%)
- Priority planting in heat island neighborhoods
- Green building requirements: cool roofs, water efficiency, solar-ready
- Wildfire smoke response plan: clean air shelters in every neighborhood
- Water conservation and xeriscaping incentives

### International Evidence: Clean Energy and Environmental Justice

| Country/City | Model | Result |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| **Germany (*Energiewende*)** | National energy transition: massive solar and wind investment. Feed-in tariffs guarantee prices for renewable producers. Community-owned energy cooperatives. | 46% electricity from renewables (2022). 1.7M energy jobs created. Citizen cooperatives own 40% of renewable capacity. |
| **Denmark** | 80%+ electricity from renewables. Community ownership of wind farms. | On track for 100% renewable by 2030. Created an entire export industry (Vestas). Reduced emissions while growing the economy. |
| **Costa Rica** | 98%+ electricity from renewables for 7+ consecutive years. | Proves 100% renewable is achievable today, not a future aspiration. |
| **Burlington, VT** | First US city to achieve 100% renewable electricity (2014). City-owned utility. | If Burlington can do it, Denver can do it. |
| **Flint, Michigan (cautionary tale)** | Government ignored lead contamination in water to save money. | Demonstrated what happens when governments prioritize cost-cutting over public health. Denver must not repeat this with Rocky Flats or Front Range lead. |

**Denver's solar advantage:** Denver gets 300+ days of sunshine per year. The economics of solar are overwhelmingly favorable. The barrier is political will, not technology or cost.

## How We Pay For It

- Rocky Flats investigation: $5-10M (with goal of federal cost recovery through litigation)
- Lead remediation: Federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funds + city bonds
- Renewable city operations: Saves money long-term through reduced energy costs; financed through green bonds
- Environmental Justice: EPA Environmental Justice grants + city climate fund
- Total city investment: $20-30M/year, with significant federal cost recovery potential

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Isn't Rocky Flats cleaned up?"**
The DOE declared it cleaned up. Independent scientists disagree. Plutonium has a half-life of 24,000 years. The cleanup addressed surface contamination but left subsurface contamination in place, covered with soil. Wind erosion, flooding, and wildfire can re-expose this material. Denver residents deserve an independent assessment, not the word of the agency that created the contamination.

**"100% renewable by 2030 is too aggressive."**
Burlington, VT achieved 100% renewable electricity in 2014. Other cities have followed. Denver has more solar potential than almost any major US city. The technology exists. What's missing is political will.
