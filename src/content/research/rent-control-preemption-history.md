# Colorado Rent Control Preemption: Legislative History & Strategic Analysis

## The 1981 Ban: CRS § 38-12-301 (The Rental Housing Act)

Colorado banned local rent control ordinances in **1981** with the Rental Housing Act (CRS § 38-12-301). The law declares rent control a "matter of statewide concern" and prohibits counties and municipalities from enacting any ordinance or resolution that would "control rent on either private residential property or a private residential housing unit."

**Origin:** The ban was a direct response to a citizen-led rent control ballot initiative in Boulder, which would have imposed a 120-day freeze on rent increases, with landlords needing permission from an elected five-member panel for any increase beyond inflation. The real estate industry pushed the statewide preemption through the legislature to preempt Boulder and prevent any other city from following suit.

**Reinforced in 2000:** A Colorado Supreme Court ruling involving a Telluride ordinance further cemented the preemption.

## Legislative Attempts to Repeal the Preemption

### SB19-225 — Authorize Local Governments to Stabilize Rent (2019)

- **Sponsors:** Senate Democrats
- **What it did:** Would have repealed the statutory language prohibiting local rent control and authorized local governments to enact rent stabilization measures.
- **Outcome:** Failed to pass. Did not gain traction in committee.

### HB23-1115 — Repeal Prohibition on Local Residential Rent Control (2023)

**This is the most significant and closest-to-passing attempt to date.**

- **Prime sponsors:** Rep. Javier Mabrey (D-Denver), Rep. Elizabeth Velasco (D-Glenwood Springs), with 20+ Democratic co-sponsors
- **What it did:** Would have repealed CRS § 38-12-301. It did NOT implement any rent control — it simply removed the ban, allowing local governments to make their own decisions.

| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Jan 24, 2023 | Bill introduced in the House                                                 |
| Feb 2023     | Passed House committee                                                       |

| Apr 25, 2023 | **Killed in Senate Local Government & Housing Committee, 4-3**               |

#### The Decisive Vote: Sen. Dylan Roberts (D-Avon)

The bill died because **one Democratic senator — Dylan Roberts — sided with 3 Republicans** on the Senate Local Government & Housing Committee.

**Roberts' stated reasons:**

1. **Mountain town spillover:** If one mountain town enacted rent control, it would "push demand to other towns, increasing their rents"
2. **Development concerns:** "Rent control, even in a local manner like this, could — and probably would — stifle development"
3. **Vacation rental conversion:** Rent control could "speed the conversion of existing long-term rental units into vacation rentals"

**Counter-arguments from supporters:**

- Sen. Sonya Jaquez Lewis (committee chair, voted yes): "We're missing a huge opportunity here to allow local communities to do something about what is happening in our state"
- The bill had guardrails (CPI+3% floor, 15-year new construction exemption) specifically to address development concerns
- The bill was about **local authority**, not mandating rent control

### 2024 Session — Another Attempt, Another Failure

A rent control preemption repeal bill was proposed again in 2024 but **did not advance past committee**. The 2024 session instead focused on adjacent renter protections:

- **HB24-1098:** Just-cause eviction protections — landlords can no longer evict solely because a lease expired. Colorado became the 6th state with for-cause eviction laws.
- **HB24-1057:** Ban on algorithmic rent-setting (RealPage, etc.) — sponsored by Mabrey, did not pass in 2024.

**Governor Polis** publicly opposed rent control, calling it "false hope" that fixes prices without addressing housing supply.

---

### 2025 Session — No Direct Repeal Attempt

The 2025 session (ended May 7, 2025) had a **smaller housing focus** after 2024's major land use reforms. No rent control preemption repeal was introduced. Key renter bills that did pass:

- **HB25-1004:** Banned algorithmic rent-setting software (RealPage ban — the 2024 bill reintroduced and passed)
- **HB25-1090:** "Junk fees" ban — landlords must disclose total rental cost upfront, effective January 1, 2026
- **HB25-1236:** Tenants receiving housing subsidies cannot be required to submit credit reports
- **HB25-1092:** Clarified "reasonable" rent increases under just-cause eviction law — this was a **pro-landlord** bill that was killed in committee

---

### 2026 Session — Current (Started January 14, 2026)

The 2026 session is underway. **No rent control preemption repeal bill has been identified in early filings** as of February 2026. Key housing bills so far:

- **HB26-1001:** Housing developments on qualifying properties (co-sponsored by Mabrey)
- **HB26-1005:** Housing bill (co-sponsored by Mabrey and Rep. Jennifer Bacon)
- **HB26-1066:** Property tax exemption for affordable rental units

The absence of a rent control repeal bill in 2026 may represent an opening for advocacy — or it may signal that sponsors are waiting for a more favorable political moment.

## Why HB23-1115 Failed: Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Senate Math Problem

The bill passed the **House** with a healthy margin (40-24). The problem was the Senate committee, where a single moderate Democrat (Roberts) killed it. This is a **one-vote margin** problem, not a fundamental opposition problem.

### 2. Governor Opposition

Gov. Polis has consistently opposed rent control. Even if a bill passed both chambers, it would face a veto. This means either:

- Building a veto-proof majority (difficult)
- Waiting for a more sympathetic governor (2027 inauguration after 2026 election)
- State ballot initiative (bypasses governor entirely)

### 3. "Supply vs. Regulation" Framing

Opponents successfully framed the debate as "rent control vs. building more housing," a false binary. The bill's supporters did not effectively counter that HB23-1115 explicitly allowed for supply-side measures alongside rent stabilization.

### 4. Mountain Town vs. Urban Split

Roberts' concerns about mountain town spillover effects exposed a coalition weakness: the bill's Denver/urban coalition did not adequately address rural/resort community concerns.

### 5. Real Estate Industry Lobbying

The Colorado Apartment Association, Colorado Bankers Association, and real estate industry lobbied heavily against the bill. Written testimony included claims that rent control "limits new supply" and "removes existing housing from the market."

## Strategic Paths Forward

### Path A: Amended State Bill (Next Session)

Re-introduce an amended version of HB23-1115 that addresses the specific objections that killed it:

**Amendments to consider:**

| Roberts Objection          | Potential Amendment                                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Mountain town spillover    | Add population threshold (e.g., only municipalities >50,000 or counties >100,000) or require regional coordination |
| Stifle development         | Strengthen the 15-year new construction exemption; add developer incentive provisions                              |
| Vacation rental conversion | Add anti-conversion provisions — units under rent stabilization cannot be converted to short-term rentals          |

**Additional strengthening amendments:**

- Sunset clause (10-year expiration requiring re-authorization) to reduce perceived risk
- Require local governments to pair rent stabilization with housing supply goals
- Include vacancy decontrol prohibition at the state level (prevent weak local implementations)
- Annual reporting requirements to the legislature on impacts

### Path B: State Ballot Initiative (Bypass Legislature Entirely)

Colorado allows citizen-initiated statutes. This bypasses both the legislature and the governor.

**Requirements:**

- Gather signatures equal to 5% of votes cast for Secretary of State in the last general election
- File with the Title Board at least 6 months before the election
- Typically need ~125,000–150,000 valid signatures

**Timeline for November 2026 ballot:**

- Title Board filing: by approximately May 2026
- Signature gathering: May–August 2026
- This is extremely tight — a 2028 ballot initiative may be more realistic

### Path C: Denver "Trigger" Ordinance (Parallel Track)

As already identified in your LEGISLATION-READY.md, Denver can pass a **trigger ordinance** — a rent stabilization law that automatically takes effect the moment state preemption is lifted.

**Strategic value:**

- Demonstrates concrete demand and political will
- Creates a ready-made implementation framework
- Pressures state legislators: "Denver is ready — just lift the ban"
- Can be passed by Denver City Council under existing home rule authority
- Builds public awareness and coalition

### Path D: Legal Challenge to CRS § 38-12-301

Denver has **home rule authority** under the Colorado Constitution. A legal theory exists that the 1981 preemption may not apply to home rule municipalities for matters of "local concern." This is untested and risky but could be a parallel pressure strategy.

### Path E: Coalition Building Across Colorado Cities

The 2023 failure was partly a coalition problem. Build a statewide coalition:

- **Denver** (50%+ renters, highest absolute renter population)
- **Boulder** (history of rent control activism, university town)
- **Aurora** (growing renter population, diverse community)
- **Colorado Springs** (growing affordability crisis)
- **Mountain towns** (Telluride, Aspen, Breckenridge — extreme affordability crises)

A multi-city coalition sending a unified message to the legislature is harder to dismiss than a "Denver issue."

| Sen. Sonya Jaquez Lewis        | Committee chair (2023)  | Advocate        | "We're missing a huge opportunity"                      |
| Sen. Julie Gonzales            | Sponsor (algorithm ban) | Advocate        | Co-sponsored related renter protection bills            |

## Recommendation for Denver For All

**Pursue a multi-track strategy simultaneously:**

1. **Immediate (2026):** Draft and advocate for a Denver trigger ordinance — the Rent Stabilization Act described in our policy platform, structured to take effect when CRS § 38-12-301 is repealed
2. **2026 session:** Work with Mabrey and Bacon's offices to either (a) introduce an amended preemption repeal bill this session, or (b) lay groundwork for 2027
3. **2026–2027:** Begin coalition-building with Boulder, Aurora, Colorado Springs, and mountain town organizations
4. **2027:** New governor takes office (Polis is term-limited). This is the most strategic window for a preemption repeal bill
5. **Backup:** If legislative path stalls, prepare for a 2028 state ballot initiative

The 1981 preemption is the single biggest legal obstacle to Denver's rent stabilization goals. Every other piece of our housing platform (vacancy tax, social housing, tenant protections) can move forward independently — but rent control requires state action first.
