# DenverForAll.org — Funding Collateral

Grassroots fundraising materials and partnership outreach for DenverForAll's policy research, civic tools, and organizing infrastructure.

## Strategy: Open Collective + Small Grassroots Donations

**Open Collective** for transparent grassroots fundraising. Currently applying for fiscal hosting through **Open Source Collective**. No grants, no 501(c)(3), no gatekeepers. Public real-time ledger showing every dollar in and every dollar out.

$200–800/month from small donors funds all ongoing operations: Claude API tokens for policy research, Resistbot amplification, data visualizations, hosting upgrades, and bilingual translations.
