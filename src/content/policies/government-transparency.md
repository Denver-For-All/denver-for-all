## The Problem

Denver is building a surveillance infrastructure with no democratic oversight. The Denver Police Department operates more than 100 Flock Safety automatic license plate reader (ALPR) cameras across nearly 70 intersections, photographing over 2 million vehicles per month (DPD Flock Transparency Dashboard, 2025). The city also maintains a ShotSpotter/SoundThinking acoustic surveillance network (a $4.7 million contract renewed in 2022 over the objections of nearly two dozen community members) with sensors concentrated in low-income neighborhoods and communities of color including Montbello, East Colfax, North Park Hill, Five Points, and Lincoln Park (Colorado Newsline, 2024). None of these systems required voter approval or meaningful public input before deployment. When leaked Flock audit logs revealed that Denver's camera data had been searched more than 1,400 times by ICE since June 2024, DPD and the mayor's office delayed releasing those logs for over three months (Denver Gazette, 2025).

The money problem is just as severe. Denver's 2023 municipal election was the most expensive in city history. Sixteen mayoral candidates raised over $6.6 million, while outside groups spent an additional $3.6 million through unlimited super PAC contributions (Colorado Sun, 2023). Three wealthy donors (LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, former NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and former DaVita CEO Kent Thiry) gave a combined $2.3 million to Advancing Denver, the super PAC backing Mike Johnston (Axios Denver, 2023). The Fair Elections Fund matched $7.7 million in small donations, but super PAC spending overwhelmed the program's intent. Corporate money still drives Denver politics, and the revolving door between city government, real estate developers, and city contractors remains wide open.

Denver's transparency gaps extend into everyday governance. The Denver Open Data Catalog provides some datasets such as vendor payments, crime offenses, and traffic accidents, but critical information remains inaccessible or incomplete. Full text of city contracts is not publicly searchable. Police use-of-force data, complaint outcomes, and disciplinary records lack granular public reporting. Advisory board and commission meetings are not consistently livestreamed or archived. The city has no public inventory of algorithmic decision-making tools used in policing, benefits eligibility, permitting, or hiring, and no audit process for bias in those systems. Denver's lobbyist registration system exists through the Clerk and Recorder's office, but lobbyist contact logs with city officials are not published in a searchable public database, and the Denver Code of Ethics allows gifts of "trivial value" ($25 or less) from lobbyists and contractors with no aggregate cap (Denver Board of Ethics, 2024).

### What Denver Currently Does

**Open Data:** Denver's Open Data Catalog (denvergov.org/opendata) publishes datasets on vendor payments, crime offenses, parcels, traffic accidents, bike routes, and council districts. The Transparent Denver initiative provides budget documents, financial reports, and an online checkbook. DPD publishes performance dashboards on crime, calls for service, officer-involved shootings, and complaints. The PocketGov app provides service schedules and notifications. However, the catalog lacks full contract text, real-time spending, comprehensive police accountability data, and algorithmic system inventories.

**Campaign Finance:** Denver's Fair Elections Fund, approved by 70% of voters in 2018, provides 9-to-1 public matching on donations of $5 to $50. Participating candidates accept lower contribution limits: $500 for mayor, $350 for at-large council, and $200 for district council (compared to $1,000, $700, and $400 for non-participating candidates). In 2023, the program doubled individual donors from 25,000 in 2019 to over 50,000 and dropped the average donation from $300 to $100. The fund accounted for 64% of fundraising for at-large council candidates. New rules approved in February 2025 ban anonymous donations, require neutral debates, and enable campaign finance investigations. Non-participating candidates can now accept up to $1,190 per donor.

**Lobbyist Registration:** Denver requires lobbyist registration through the Clerk and Recorder. The Board of Ethics administers the Code of Ethics, which prohibits gifts from lobbyists and contractors to officials who are in a position to take direct action on matters involving the donor, but allows exceptions for items of "trivial value" ($25 or less) and small food and beverages. Colorado's Amendment 41 caps gifts at $53/year and includes a two-year revolving door provision for statewide officeholders, but Denver's local code has been flagged by the Colorado Independent Ethics Commission as potentially less restrictive than state standards (Denver Post, 2017).

**Surveillance:** Denver has no surveillance technology oversight ordinance. No city council vote is required before DPD acquires or deploys new surveillance systems. When the city council voted 12-0 against renewing the Flock camera contract in May 2025, Mayor Johnston bypassed the council by signing a $498,509 contract -- just under the $500,000 threshold requiring council approval (Denver Gazette, 2025). Hundreds of residents packed a town hall to protest, and more than a dozen civil liberties organizations condemned the maneuver (ACLU of Colorado, 2025).

## Our Solution

### 1. Surveillance Technology Oversight Ordinance

- City council approval required BEFORE any surveillance technology is acquired or deployed. No exceptions, no threshold games
- Annual public hearings on all active surveillance systems, with community testimony
- Privacy impact assessments for all surveillance technologies, published publicly before any council vote
- Community input process before deployment in any neighborhood, with 60-day comment periods
- Facial recognition ban for all city agencies, including the Denver Police Department
- ALPR data retention limited to 30 days -- the current system photographs millions of vehicles monthly with no clear retention limit
- No sharing surveillance data with ICE or federal immigration authorities, with automatic contract termination and referral to the Colorado Attorney General for violations (cross-reference: [Immigration & Sanctuary City](/platform/immigration-sanctuary))
- Public dashboard showing all active surveillance technologies, their cost, data retention policies, access logs, and annual effectiveness reports

### 2. Open Data & Open Government

- All city spending data published in real-time, searchable, and downloadable, with continuous updates replacing quarterly reports
- Police data: use of force incidents, civilian complaints, disciplinary outcomes, and stop data, all public and updated monthly (cross-reference: [Public Safety & Policing](/platform/public-safety))
- City contracts: full text of every contract over $25,000 publicly accessible and keyword-searchable
- Meeting transparency: all advisory board and commission meetings livestreamed and archived with searchable transcripts
- 311 service request data: public dashboard with response times broken down by neighborhood, with equity metrics
- Open source: city-developed software released as open source where possible, starting with internal tools and data pipelines

### 3. Publicly Financed Elections

Denver's Fair Elections Fund is a strong start. It doubled donor participation and shifted fundraising toward small donors. But super PACs spent over $8 million in 2023, drowning out the program's impact. We need to go further:

- Strengthen the Fair Elections Fund with democracy vouchers: every registered Denver voter receives $50 in democracy vouchers to donate to participating candidates, modeled on Seattle's program
- Maintain the 9:1 public match on small donations under $50 and explore increasing to a higher match ratio for donations under $25
- Lower contribution limits for non-participating candidates to close the gap that incentivizes opting out
- Ban corporate contributions to city campaigns. The Fair Elections Fund already prohibits business and LLC contributions for participating candidates; extend this to all candidates
- Independent redistricting for city council districts, removing incumbent self-interest from the process

### 4. Lobbyist Disclosure & Ethics Reform

- Comprehensive lobbyist disclosure: publish all contacts between registered lobbyists and city officials in a searchable public database, updated within 48 hours
- Two-year cooling-off period: city officials cannot lobby the city for two years after leaving office. Denver's local code should match or exceed Colorado's Amendment 41 revolving door provision
- Gift ban: zero-dollar gift limit from lobbyists, contractors, and entities with business before the city. The current $25 "trivial value" exception and coffee loophole must go
- Conflict of interest disclosure for all appointed board and commission members, published online before confirmation
- Public database of all lobbyist activity, searchable by official, lobbyist, client, issue, and dollar amount

### 5. Algorithmic Accountability

- Audit all algorithms and automated decision-making tools used in city operations: policing, benefits eligibility, permitting, hiring, code enforcement
- Publish impact assessments for any algorithmic system that affects residents, including the data sources, logic, error rates, and demographic impact
- Mandatory bias testing before deployment, with independent third-party review
- Right to human review: any Denver resident can request a human review of an algorithmic decision affecting them, with a response within 30 days
- Ban predictive policing algorithms that reinforce racial disparities. Studies consistently show these systems target Black and Latino neighborhoods based on biased historical data, not actual crime patterns (MIT Technology Review, 2019)

### 6. Data Sovereignty & Digital Public Infrastructure

Barcelona treats data as public infrastructure, on par with roads, water, and electricity. Denver should do the same. The current model, where private corporations extract data from city operations and residents with no public benefit, is the digital equivalent of privatizing water.

- **Municipal data commons:** Establish a Denver Data Trust, a publicly governed entity that manages city-generated data as a shared resource. Anonymized transit ridership data, energy usage patterns, housing market trends, and service utilization data should be available to researchers, community organizations, and residents, free from vendor contracts and private data brokers.
- **Data sovereignty for residents:** Denver residents should control their own data. Adopt Barcelona's DECODE framework: residents can selectively share personal data with city services using privacy-preserving technology, and revoke access at any time. No city service should require residents to surrender data to private third parties as a condition of access.
- **Vendor data requirements:** Any company contracting with Denver must: (1) return all data generated through city operations to the city upon contract termination; (2) provide data in open, interoperable formats; (3) not sell, share, or monetize city-generated data without explicit council approval. No more vendor lock-in through data hostage-taking.
- **Join the Cities Coalition for Digital Rights:** Barcelona, Amsterdam, and New York City launched this global coalition in 2018. Member cities commit to protecting digital rights including privacy, data sovereignty, and algorithmic transparency. Denver should join and adopt the coalition's principles as binding policy.
- **Open-source city technology:** Expand the open-source requirement (Section 2) to mandate that all new city software contracts include open-source licensing where feasible. Barcelona's Decidim platform, used for participatory budgeting in 80+ cities worldwide, was built as open-source by design. Denver's digital infrastructure should be a public good, not proprietary vendor property.
- **Digital equity:** Pair data sovereignty with the [Municipal Broadband](/platform/municipal-broadband) initiative to ensure that digital public infrastructure serves every resident regardless of income. Free municipal broadband + data sovereignty + algorithmic accountability = a digital infrastructure that works for people, not corporations.

### International Evidence: Transparency Strengthens Democracy

| Country/City | Model | Result |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| **Estonia** | E-government and digital transparency. 99% of government services online. Citizens use a "Data Tracker" to see exactly who accesses their personal data. Unauthorized access is a criminal offense. | Saves the equivalent of 2% of GDP annually. 95% of citizens trust the government with their data. In 2020, a police officer was fined for accessing his fiancee's data without authorization. |
| **Taiwan** | vTaiwan digital democracy platform using Pol.is for consensus-building on complex policy issues. Surfaced agreement rather than division. | 200,000 participants. 80% of issues discussed led to decisive government action. Resolved the six-year deadlock over Uber regulation through structured public deliberation. |
| **Barcelona, Spain** | Decidim open-source participatory democracy platform. DECODE project for citizen data sovereignty using decentralized encryption. Data treated as public infrastructure alongside roads, water, and electricity. | 39,000 participants submitted 11,000 proposals; 8,000 were accepted and monitored. Platform adopted by 80+ governments worldwide including Helsinki and Mexico City. DECODE project with Amsterdam pioneered privacy-preserving citizen data control. |
| **Seattle, USA** | Democracy vouchers: four $25 vouchers sent to every eligible resident for municipal campaigns. Candidates must accept spending limits. | Over 106,000 residents have contributed vouchers, distributing $10M+ to campaigns. Donor participation increased fivefold. Voucher users closely mirror city demographics by race, income, and age. Program renewed by voters in 2025. |
| **New York City, USA** | 8:1 small donor matching program. First $250 of individual contributions matched at 8-to-1 with public funds. | 94% of candidates participated in 2021. 90% of census blocks had at least one small donor to city council races vs. 30% for unmatched state races. Donor pool dramatically more diverse by race and income. |

These examples share a common lesson: transparency and democratic participation reinforce each other. When residents can see how their government spends money, who influences decisions, and how surveillance tools are used, they engage more. When more people participate in elections through small-donor programs, elected officials become accountable to constituents rather than wealthy donors. Estonia proves that radical data transparency builds trust rather than eroding it. Seattle and NYC prove that public campaign financing diversifies who participates in democracy. Denver already has the Fair Elections Fund; now we need the full transparency infrastructure to match.

## How We Pay For It

- **Surveillance oversight:** $1-2M/year for audits, dedicated staff, public dashboard development and maintenance, and annual reporting
- **Open data infrastructure:** $2-3M/year for platform upgrades, data engineering staff, data quality assurance, and real-time publishing systems
- **Democracy vouchers:** $3-5M/year amortized across each election cycle. Seattle's program costs less than $3 per resident per year
- **Ethics reform:** $500K-1M/year for enforcement staff, lobbyist registration system upgrades, and public database maintenance
- **Algorithmic accountability:** $1-2M/year for independent audits, bias testing, and impact assessment publication
- **Data sovereignty & digital infrastructure:** $2-4M/year for Denver Data Trust operations, vendor data migration, open-source development, and Cities Coalition for Digital Rights membership and implementation
- **Total: $10-17M/year** -- a fraction of what the city spends on the systems being overseen. Denver's Flock camera contract alone costs nearly $500K, and the ShotSpotter contract was $4.7M. The Fair Elections Fund disbursed $7.7M in a single cycle. Transparency infrastructure is cheap compared to the cost of governing in the dark.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Surveillance keeps us safe. Why restrict it?"**
Denver attributed 352 arrests and 250 recovered stolen vehicles to Flock cameras, but auto thefts dropped from 12,000 to 8,550 during a period when auto thefts declined nationally. Independent research finds no consistent evidence that ALPR camera networks reduce crime. A review across multiple cities found cameras did not reliably lower crime rates, and experts say establishing a causal link between Flock cameras and crime reduction is difficult (Forbes, 2024). What Flock cameras do create is a mass tracking database that photographed over 2 million vehicles in a single month in Denver, with data searched over 1,400 times by ICE. The question is not whether to abolish surveillance tools; it is whether residents get a democratic vote before those tools are deployed in their neighborhoods, with clear rules about data retention and access.

**"Democracy vouchers are a waste of taxpayer money."**
Seattle's democracy voucher program costs less than $3 per resident per year. It has distributed over $10 million to local campaigns, increased donor participation fivefold, and made the donor pool closely match city demographics by race, income, and age. Denver's Fair Elections Fund already operates on a similar principle: 9:1 matching approved by 70% of voters. Democracy vouchers extend that principle to every registered voter, whether or not they already donate to campaigns. The 2023 Denver election saw super PACs spend over $8 million. If that is not a waste of money, $3 per resident to diversify who funds elections certainly is not either.

**"Open data could be misused."**
Personal data is excluded from open data requirements. This is about operational data on how government spends money, awards contracts, deploys surveillance, and uses power. The current system is the one creating risk: Denver's Flock camera data was accessed by ICE without public knowledge for months. Open data with clear privacy protections reduces misuse by making government actions visible and accountable. Estonia publishes who accesses citizen data and treats unauthorized access as a criminal offense, and 95% of Estonians trust their government with their data as a result.

**"This will slow down government."**
Publishing data and requiring public input before deploying surveillance adds days or weeks to processes that currently happen behind closed doors. The real question is why the Denver Police Department acquired a mass surveillance network without a council vote, why the mayor signed a $498,509 contract specifically structured to dodge the $500,000 council approval threshold, and why audit logs showing ICE access were withheld for three months. Transparency requirements do not slow down good governance -- they slow down end-runs around democratic accountability, and that is the point.

**"Algorithmic tools are objective and remove human bias."**
Algorithms encode the biases of their training data. Predictive policing systems trained on historical arrest data will target the same neighborhoods that were over-policed in the past (predominantly Black and Latino communities) regardless of where crime actually occurs. The Chicago Police Department's "Strategic Subject List" and the LAPD's PredPol system were both abandoned after evidence showed they reinforced racial disparities without improving public safety (MIT Technology Review, 2019). Denver deploys ShotSpotter sensors overwhelmingly in communities of color. Without independent audits and bias testing, algorithmic systems launder human prejudice through a veneer of technological objectivity.

## State-Level Strategy: Levers Beyond City Hall

Denver is a home rule municipality under Article XX of the Colorado Constitution, which means the state generally cannot dictate Denver's internal governance structure. But the state can, and should, act on issues that rise to statewide concern: civil rights, privacy, campaign finance, and democratic accountability. Here are the state-level levers that would directly strengthen Denver's ability to implement the reforms above.

### Lift the Rent Control Preemption

Colorado Revised Statutes Section 38-12-301 (the Rental Housing Act of 1981) prohibits all local rent control ordinances statewide. Denver cannot implement rent stabilization until this preemption is lifted.

- **HB 23-1115** passed the Colorado House but died in the Senate Local Government & Housing Committee by a vote of 3-4. A single Democratic senator (Dylan Roberts) voted with three Republicans to kill it.
- Governor Polis has publicly opposed rent control and threatened to veto any repeal.
- **Ballot initiative strategy:** A voter-initiated measure to repeal C.R.S. 38-12-301 would bypass the governor entirely. Colorado allows citizen-initiated statutes with sufficient petition signatures. This is the most viable path given gubernatorial opposition.
- **Interim protections that have passed (2025):** HB25-1004 (banning algorithmic rent coordination like RealPage), HB25-1090 (junk fee transparency), HB25-1249 (security deposit return), SB25-020 (landlord-tenant enforcement).

### Pass a State Surveillance Oversight Law

Colorado has no law requiring city council approval before police departments acquire surveillance technology. This is the structural gap that allowed Mayor Johnston to deploy Flock cameras without a vote and bypass the council after they voted 12-0 against renewal.

- **California's AB 481** (enacted 2021) requires legislative body approval for all law enforcement surveillance and military-grade equipment acquisitions. Annual reporting, public comment periods, and use policies are mandatory. 26 jurisdictions nationwide have adopted similar CCOPS (Community Control Over Police Surveillance) ordinances.
- Colorado has existing precedent: **SB 22-113** already requires city council notification for facial recognition. **HB 24-1130** regulates biometric data. A comprehensive surveillance oversight bill framed as a civil rights and privacy measure (statewide concern) would likely survive home rule challenges.
- **The Flock situation is the case study:** If a state law had required council approval for ALPR acquisitions, Mayor Johnston could not have deployed the cameras unilaterally, and the $498,509 threshold-dodging contract would have been illegal.

### Reintroduce Dark Money and Lobbyist Reform (SB25-148)

Senator Mike Weissman's **SB25-148** would have banned year-round lobbyist contributions (currently only banned during session), required 24-hour reporting of independent expenditures over $1,000, and mandated that federal PACs contributing to Colorado elections disclose their top donors. It failed 3-2 in the Senate State, Veterans, & Military Affairs Committee. A single Democratic defection killed it.

- Colorado lobbyists self-reported nearly $500,000 in contributions to statehouse candidates during the 2024 cycle.
- In November 2025, the Independent Ethics Commission unanimously advanced ethics complaints against 17 Democratic state legislators for allegedly accepting luxury resort expenses at an October gathering with lobbyists in Vail ($32,671.15 total).
- Reintroduction in 2026 with broader coalition support is viable. The ethics complaints against sitting legislators have created public momentum for reform.

### Denver Charter Amendment Targets

These changes require a ballot measure approved by Denver voters, not state legislation. But state-level advocacy organizations and a grassroots campaign can build support.

1. **Lower the veto override threshold** from 9-of-13 (69%) to 8-of-13 (62%, a standard two-thirds). The current threshold means the mayor only needs 5 allies to sustain any veto, making the council structurally weak.
2. **Require council approval for all surveillance and AI technology contracts** regardless of dollar amount. No threshold manipulation.
3. **Lower the general contract approval threshold** from $500,000. The current threshold is what Johnston exploited to sign the $498,509 Flock contract.
4. **Require council confirmation** of key mayoral cabinet appointments (Chief of Police, Director of Public Safety, Manager of Public Works).

### What Denver Can Already Do Without the State

Not everything requires state permission. Denver's home rule authority already allows:

- **Surveillance oversight ordinance:** Denver can require council approval for surveillance tech acquisitions right now. No state law prevents this.
- **Minimum wage increases:** HB 19-1210 (2019) repealed the state preemption on local minimum wages. Denver can raise to $25/hr with phased annual increases.
- **Fair Elections Fund expansion:** Denver can add democracy vouchers, lower contribution limits further, and ban corporate contributions for all candidates, regardless of Fair Elections Fund participation.
- **Ethics reform:** Denver can close the $25 "trivial value" gift loophole, impose aggregate caps, and strengthen the two-year revolving door restriction.
- **Paid leave and labor protections:** No state preemption exists on most local labor ordinances. Sectoral bargaining, right to disconnect, gig worker protections, and works councils are all within Denver's authority.

The barrier is not legal authority -- it is political will and the concentration of executive power in the mayor's office. That is why charter reform and state-level structural changes matter.
