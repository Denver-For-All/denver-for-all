## Key Eligibility Notes

- Model A: Project becomes legally part of Social Good Fund (uses their 501(c)(3) status and EIN)
- DenverForAll is NOT currently incorporated — this is ideal for Model A (no dissolution needed)
- Activities must meet 501(c)(3) charitable purpose standard
- No partisan political activity (supporting/opposing candidates) — DenverForAll's candidate tracker publishes unedited responses without endorsement, which qualifies as nonpartisan voter education
- Lobbying must not be the "primary activity" — DenverForAll's primary activities are research, education, and civic tools, with advocacy as a component

## Application Narrative

*Adapt the following for the online application form.*

### Organization/Project Name
Denver For All

### Website
https://denverforall.org

### Mission Statement

Denver For All is a grassroots civic organization that produces evidence-based policy research, builds free interactive civic tools, and organizes tenants, workers, and communities in Denver to advance housing justice, economic equity, and government accountability.

### Project Description

Denver For All operates a comprehensive civic engagement platform serving Denver residents through three primary activities:

**1. Policy Research & Education (Primary Activity)**
We produce 47 detailed, data-driven policy analyses covering housing, labor, healthcare, public safety, immigration, infrastructure, and democratic governance. Each proposal includes peer-reviewed evidence, international case studies, Denver-specific data, cost-benefit analysis, and implementation pathways. All research is published free and open source as a public educational resource.

**2. Free Civic Technology Tools**
We build and maintain 8 interactive tools that empower residents and promote government transparency:
- An eviction tracker mapping displacement patterns across Denver neighborhoods
- A rent calculator showing the impact of proposed rent stabilization policies
- A campaign finance tracker exposing the influence of money in local politics
- A 24/7 AI-powered tenant rights chatbot available in English and Spanish
- A sidewalk safety data explorer mapping infrastructure gaps
- Nonpartisan candidate trackers publishing unedited responses to standardized policy surveys

**3. Community Education & Organizing**
We conduct grassroots outreach through social media, community groups, Spanish-language communities, and direct action channels (Resistbot petition campaigns, letter-writing tools) to educate residents about their rights and civic opportunities.

### Why Fiscal Sponsorship?

Denver For All is a volunteer-run project that has built significant civic infrastructure on a budget of under $840/year. We are now reaching ~600 unique visitors per week and have a complete platform of 47 policy proposals, 8 civic tools, 6 federal grant templates, and a comprehensive organizing playbook. Fiscal sponsorship through Social Good Fund would allow us to:

1. **Accept tax-deductible donations** from supporters who want to fund continued policy research, tool development, and bilingual access
2. **Apply for foundation grants** that require 501(c)(3) status — including the Denver Foundation Community Grants Program ($20K–$50K, deadline March 2, 2026) and the Caring for Denver Foundation ($200K–$800K, opening March 2026)
3. **Scale our impact** without the overhead and delay of incorporating as a standalone nonprofit

We do not intend to hire staff immediately. Initial funding would support direct project costs: AI-powered research and analysis tools, bilingual translation, civic tool hosting, and community outreach materials.
