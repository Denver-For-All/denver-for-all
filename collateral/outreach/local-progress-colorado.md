**Subject:** Denver For All — Organizational Partner Inquiry for Local Progress Colorado

Dear Local Progress Colorado team,

I'm reaching out to explore organizational partnership with Local Progress on behalf of Denver For All (denverforall.org), a grassroots civic platform building power for working people in Denver.

### What We Bring to the Network

Denver For All has built what we believe is one of the most comprehensive municipal policy research platforms in Colorado:

- **47 evidence-based policy proposals** covering housing, labor, healthcare, public safety, immigration, infrastructure, and democratic governance
- **8 free civic tools** including an eviction tracker, campaign finance transparency tracker, rent calculator, and bilingual AI tenant rights chatbot
- **6 federal grant templates** ready for council members and city staff to file for HUD, FEMA, BEAD, and Safe Streets funding
- **Legislative readiness analysis** identifying 10 proposals that can be introduced to Denver City Council immediately

### Direct Alignment with Local Progress Priorities

Our platform directly mirrors Local Progress policy priorities:

| Local Progress Priority       | Denver For All Proposal                                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rent control                  | Rent Stabilization (CPI or 3%, no vacancy decontrol) + preemption history analysis |
| Tenant right to lease renewal | Tenant Bill of Rights with comprehensive protections                               |
| Housing First                 | 10,000-unit social housing program modeled on Vienna                               |
| Living wage                   | $25/hr minimum indexed to CPI, eliminate tipped minimum                            |
| Police alternatives           | STAR program expansion backed by Urban Institute data                              |
| Participatory budgeting       | Full proposal with implementation timeline                                         |
| Municipal broadband           | Full proposal — 85% voter approval in 2018, still not built                        |

### How We Can Support Local Progress Members

1. **Research on demand:** Our AI-powered research platform can produce detailed policy analysis, cost-benefit models, and comparative case studies for any municipal issue
2. **Federal grant templates:** Council members can use our grant templates as starting points for federal funding applications
3. **Civic tools:** Our eviction tracker, campaign finance tracker, and candidate accountability tools are free and open source
4. **Community engagement:** Our Resistbot integration, newsletter, and social media channels can amplify Local Progress initiatives in Denver

### What We're Looking For

- Connection to Denver city council members and candidates aligned with progressive municipal policy
- Access to Local Progress policy resources, model legislation, and peer networks
- Collaboration opportunities for the 2027 Denver municipal election cycle
- Guidance on building relationships with the mayor's office, governor's office, and Colorado's federal delegation

We reach approximately 600 unique visitors per week and are actively seeking fiscal sponsorship to scale our impact. We'd welcome the opportunity to present our platform to the Local Progress Colorado chapter.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
Denver For All
