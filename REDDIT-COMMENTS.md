# Reddit Comments: Denver For All Contrast Messaging

Short comments for r/Denver, r/denverhousing, and similar. Tone: real person who's done their research. Frustrated but not unhinged. Light swearing, tight arguments, a source when it hits harder.

## Comment 1: Housing Supply vs. Lisa

**Context:** Thread about housing crisis, someone complaining Lisa doesn't want to build

> What kills me about Lisa is she acts like building housing and protecting renters are mutually exclusive. They're not. Vienna builds thousands of publicly owned units AND caps rent increases, and somehow the city hasn't collapsed. You can do both. Meanwhile we're stuck with a candidate who won't build and won't protect renters, so we get... nothing? Rents have damn near doubled since 2010 (Zillow ZORI data) and we have zero rent stabilization. Every major city in Europe has some form of rent regulation. Denver has jack shit.

## Comment 2: Flock Cameras and Mike's Democratic Deficit

**Context:** Thread about Mike Johnston / Flock Safety deal

> The surveillance cameras are one thing. You can argue about whether ALPRs reduce crime (the evidence is mixed at best). But the way Mike pushed through a mass surveillance contract with Flock without a real public process? That's the part that's bullshit. Council barely had time to review it. Voters weren't consulted. We now have a private company's license plate readers across the city and nobody got to weigh in. If you're confident this is good policy, put it to a damn vote. The fact that he didn't tells you everything about how this administration treats democratic accountability.

## Comment 3: Developer Subsidies vs. Public Housing

**Context:** Thread comparing Lisa and Mike on housing

> Denver spends $400-600K per unit subsidizing private developers to build "affordable" housing that expires in 15-30 years. Vienna builds permanently affordable public housing for a fraction of that. Neither Lisa nor Mike has proposed anything that breaks this cycle. Lisa won't build, and Mike builds sweetheart deals for developers with public money. There are cities and countries where housing actually works. We just refuse to learn from them.

## Comment 4: Sweeps Don't Work

**Context:** Thread about encampments / homelessness

> Sweeps cost more and accomplish less than just giving people housing. That's not some radical theory. Finland literally did this, cut homelessness by 35%, and is the only EU country where the numbers are going down (Y-Foundation data). Houston housed 25,000+ people with Housing First. Meanwhile Denver keeps spending $40-60K per person per year on the emergency services merry-go-round when permanent supportive housing costs $15-25K. We are spending more money to get worse outcomes. How is that not insane.

## Comment 5: Broadband (We Already Voted Yes)

**Context:** Thread about Comcast / internet costs

> In 2018, Denver voters passed a ballot measure authorizing municipal broadband. 85% said yes. And then... nothing happened. Longmont built NextLight, charges $50/month for gigabit, and it's profitable. Fort Collins did it despite Comcast spending $150M to stop them. Denver voters said yes seven damn years ago and we're still paying Comcast $80-120/month for worse service. That tells you everything about who city hall actually works for.

## Comment 6: Wages

**Context:** Thread about cost of living

> MIT's Living Wage Calculator says a family of four in Denver needs $25-26/hr to survive (livingwage.mit.edu). Minimum wage is $18.29. That's a $7/hr gap between what people earn and what they need. Seven states already eliminated the tipped minimum wage entirely and their restaurant industries are fine. Denmark pays fast food workers $22/hr and a Big Mac costs 80 cents more. We act like paying people enough to live is some impossible radical idea when most of the developed world already does it.
