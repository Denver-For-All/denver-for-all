## The Problem

The tipped minimum wage is a legacy of post-slavery economics. After emancipation, restaurants hired Black workers and told them to earn their wages from customer tips — allowing employers to pay nothing. This system persists today.

In Colorado, the tipped minimum is $15.27/hr (2025) — $3+/hr less than the standard minimum. Employers are supposed to make up the difference if tips don't reach the full minimum. In practice:
- Wage theft in tipped industries is rampant — employers routinely fail to make up shortfalls
- Income is unpredictable and volatile — one slow Tuesday means rent is short
- Workers are forced to tolerate harassment from customers because their income depends on it
- Tipped workers experience poverty at 2x the rate of non-tipped workers
- The system is racist: tipped workers of color earn 56% less in tips than white workers for the same work

## Our Solution

### Eliminate the tipped minimum wage in Denver

- All workers receive the full minimum wage ($25/hr at full implementation) regardless of whether they receive tips
- Tips remain 100% the property of workers — employers cannot touch them
- **Tip pooling** permitted only when ALL employees (including back-of-house) are included equitably
- **Tip theft** by employers is prosecuted as wage theft with triple damages
- **No service charges** masquerading as tips — if a restaurant adds a service charge, it must clearly disclose that it is NOT a tip and does NOT go to workers

### Transition Support

- 2-year tax credit for restaurants and bars to offset the wage differential during transition
- Free business model consulting through Denver Economic Development
- Public education campaign: "In Denver, your server earns a living wage. Tips are their bonus, not their survival."

## How We Pay For It

Restaurants pay their workers. The seven states that already have One Fair Wage (California, Washington, Oregon, Montana, Alaska, Minnesota, Nevada) have thriving restaurant industries. Restaurant job growth in these states exceeds tipped-wage states.

Menu prices may increase 5-10%. This is transparent and honest — unlike the current system where your server's poverty is hidden behind a smile.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Won't servers make less because people will stop tipping?"**
In One Fair Wage states, total compensation (wages + tips) is higher than in tipped-wage states. People still tip. The difference is that a slow night doesn't mean your server can't pay rent.

**"Restaurants operate on thin margins."**
Then their business model is subsidized by worker poverty. If a restaurant can only exist by paying workers $15/hr and hoping customers make up the rest, that's not a viable business — it's a subsidy extracted from the lowest-paid workers.

**"What about fine dining servers who make $60K+ in tips?"**
They'll still make that. They'll just ALSO make a guaranteed base wage. The people this helps most are the workers at Denny's and Applebee's, not the sommelier at the steakhouse.
