## Project Narrative

### A. Project Description

**Project Title:** Denver Community Land Trust Expansion Initiative

**Applicant:** City and County of Denver, Department of Housing Stability (HOST)

**Requested Amount:** $12,000,000

**Project Duration:** 36 months

**Project Summary:** The City and County of Denver requests $12 million in HOME Investment Partnerships Program funding to dramatically scale community land trust (CLT) acquisitions and create 500 permanently affordable homes in Denver's highest-displacement-risk neighborhoods. Denver rents have risen 85% since 2010, with the average one-bedroom now exceeding $1,600/month. The city's primary CLT operator, Elevation Community Land Trust, currently holds approximately 300 permanently affordable homes but adds only 20-40 units per year — a pace far below what is needed to counteract accelerating displacement. This project will fund property acquisition, rehabilitation, organizational capacity building, and homebuyer readiness programs to put Denver on a trajectory toward 2,500 permanently affordable CLT homes over the next decade.

### B. Location & Context

**Project Area:** City and County of Denver, Colorado (population ~715,000)

**Priority Neighborhoods (ranked by displacement risk, rent burden, and loss of affordable units):**

- Globeville
- Elyria-Swansea
- Sun Valley
- Westwood
- West Colfax
- Lincoln Park
- Northeast Park Hill
- East Colfax
- Valverde
- Villa Park
- Barnum / Barnum West
- Cole

**Urbanized Area:** Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area

**Disadvantaged Community Status:** 10 of 12 target neighborhoods qualify as disadvantaged communities under the Justice40 initiative, based on Census tract-level poverty rates, housing cost burden, and historic disinvestment indicators. These neighborhoods have experienced the highest rates of demographic change and rent escalation in the Denver metro area over the past decade.

### C. Statement of Need

Denver's housing affordability crisis has reached a scale that conventional subsidy programs cannot address alone. The data demonstrates an urgent need for permanently affordable homeownership models:

**Housing Cost Data:**

- Denver rents have increased 85% since 2010, with the average one-bedroom apartment now exceeding $1,600/month
- Median home sale price in Denver exceeded $580,000 in 2024, pricing out households earning below 120% of area median income
- More than 50% of Denver renters are cost-burdened (paying over 30% of income on housing)
- Denver lost approximately 20,000 naturally occurring affordable rental units between 2010 and 2024

**Displacement Indicators:**

- Target neighborhoods have experienced 15-40% demographic turnover in the past decade driven by rising costs
- Communities of color — particularly Latino, Black, and Indigenous households — are disproportionately affected by displacement from historically redlined neighborhoods
- Displacement severs residents from schools, jobs, healthcare, social networks, and transit access

**Limitations of Current Approaches:**

- Conventional affordable housing subsidies expire after 15-30 year compliance periods, returning units to market rate
- Denver's existing inclusionary housing ordinance produces hundreds of units annually, but affordability restrictions are time-limited
- Elevation Community Land Trust currently adds only 20-40 permanently affordable homes per year, constrained by acquisition funding
- At the current pace, the CLT model cannot scale to meaningfully offset displacement

### D. Community Land Trust Model

The community land trust model addresses the root cause of housing unaffordability — speculative land value escalation — by permanently separating land ownership from building ownership:

**How CLTs Work:**

- A nonprofit community land trust acquires land and holds it permanently on behalf of the community
- Homebuyers purchase the building (house or condo) at a below-market price, but the land beneath it remains owned by the CLT
- Homeowners pay a modest monthly ground lease fee (typically $25-75/month) that funds ongoing CLT operations
- When a CLT homeowner sells, a resale formula ensures the home remains affordable to the next buyer while allowing the seller to build modest equity
- This structure removes land speculation from the equation, keeping homes permanently affordable across generations

**Governance Structure:**

- CLTs use a tripartite governance model: one-third CLT resident homeowners, one-third community members from the surrounding neighborhood, and one-third public representatives (city officials, housing experts, nonprofit leaders)
- This structure ensures accountability to residents, responsiveness to neighborhood needs, and alignment with public policy goals

**Proven Track Record:**

- Champlain Housing Trust (Burlington, VT): 2,800+ permanently affordable homes since 1984, with foreclosure rates 10 times lower than conventional mortgages
- Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative (Boston, MA): community-controlled CLT that reversed decades of disinvestment and displacement in Roxbury and North Dorchester
- London Community Land Trust (UK) and Community Land Trust Brussels (Belgium): international models demonstrating the scalability of CLTs in high-cost urban markets

**Recent Local Success:**

- In January 2026, the Urban Land Conservancy opened **The Irving at Mile High Vista**, a 102-unit permanently affordable, all-electric housing community in West Colfax — one of the 12 target neighborhoods identified in this proposal. The Irving serves households at 20-80% AMI with 99-year affordability through ULC's community land trust, and was one of the first Proposition 123-funded projects to open. Denver HOST provided a $4,080,000 loan, demonstrating the exact type of public investment-CLT partnership this proposal seeks to scale. The Irving proves that the CLT model can deliver permanently affordable, climate-forward housing in Denver's highest-displacement-risk neighborhoods.

**Long-Term Sustainability:**

- CLTs are self-sustaining once established at scale — ground lease fees, resale transaction fees, and stewardship revenues cover ongoing operations
- Every public dollar invested in CLT acquisition creates a permanently affordable home, unlike time-limited subsidies that require repeated reinvestment
- Denver HOST already funds some Elevation CLT acquisitions, demonstrating an existing institutional partnership ready to be scaled

### E. Project Activities & Deliverables

**Activity 1: Property Acquisition in Anti-Displacement Zones ($6,000,000)**

- Acquire approximately 80-120 properties (single-family homes, duplexes, and small multifamily buildings) in the 12 target neighborhoods
- Prioritize properties at risk of speculative flipping or conversion to market-rate rentals
- Execute acquisitions in coordination with Denver HOST's anti-displacement mapping tools and early warning systems
- Ensure all acquired properties meet HOME program property standards or are candidates for rehabilitation under Activity 2
- Record permanent CLT ground lease restrictions on all acquired parcels

**Activity 2: Rehabilitation and Conversion ($3,000,000)**

- Rehabilitate acquired properties to meet HOME property standards and Denver energy efficiency requirements
- Convert acquired rental properties to CLT homeownership units where feasible
- Scope of work per unit: lead-based paint remediation, electrical and plumbing upgrades, accessibility improvements, weatherization, and health and safety repairs
- Estimated average rehabilitation cost: $25,000-60,000 per unit depending on property condition
- All rehabilitated units to meet or exceed HUD Uniform Physical Condition Standards

**Activity 3: CLT Organizational Capacity Building ($1,500,000)**

- Fund Elevation CLT staffing expansion: additional acquisition specialists, homeowner stewardship coordinators, and financial counselors

### G. Alignment with HOME Program Objectives

This project directly advances the statutory goals of the HOME Investment Partnerships Program:

1. **Expands the supply of affordable housing:** Creates 500 permanently affordable homeownership units — homes that remain affordable not for 15 or 30 years, but in perpetuity
2. **Strengthens partnerships between government and nonprofit housing providers:** Deepens the existing HOST-Elevation CLT partnership and builds organizational infrastructure for long-term CLT operations at scale
3. **Promotes homeownership for low- and moderate-income households:** CLT homes are priced affordable to households at 60-80% of area median income, with resale restrictions ensuring permanent access for future low-income buyers
4. **Leverages private and local investment:** Denver's commitment of $50 million in city bond funds, vacancy tax revenue, and ongoing HOST allocations provides a substantial local match that multiplies the impact of HOME dollars
5. **Advances fair housing goals:** Targets neighborhoods with documented histories of redlining and racial displacement, creating permanently affordable homeownership opportunities for communities of color

### H. Demonstrated Local Commitment

Denver has made substantial local investment in affordable housing and community land trusts:

- **$50 million** in planned startup funding from city bonds, HOME allocations, and vacancy tax revenue for CLT expansion over the next decade
- **Elevation Community Land Trust** has operated in Denver since 2003, demonstrating two decades of successful CLT stewardship with approximately 300 permanently affordable homes
- **Denver HOST** already funds Elevation CLT acquisitions through annual allocations, establishing the institutional framework this project will scale
- **Tripartite CLT governance** ensures community accountability, with one-third of board seats held by CLT residents, one-third by community members, and one-third by public representatives
- **Denver's Comprehensive Plan 2040** identifies community land trusts as a priority strategy for creating permanently affordable housing

The requested federal investment of $12 million represents a **4.2:1 local match ratio** against Denver's $50 million commitment — demonstrating that the city is not seeking federal funding to replace local investment, but to accelerate a program that has strong local financial and political support.
