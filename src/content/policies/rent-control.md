## The Problem

Denver renters have no protection against arbitrary rent increases. A landlord can raise your rent by $200, $500, or $1,000/month with nothing more than 60 days notice. There is no limit, no justification required, and no recourse.

The result: Denver rents have increased 95%+ since 2010. The average one-bedroom is over $1,600/month. Families are being priced out of neighborhoods they've lived in for generations. Workers who serve Denver — teachers, nurses, restaurant workers, bus drivers — can't afford to live here.

Colorado state law previously prohibited local rent control (preemption), but this is changing. Denver must be ready to act the moment preemption is lifted — or pursue a ballot initiative to establish it directly.

## Our Solution

### The Denver Rent Stabilization Act

**Annual increase cap:** Rent increases limited to the lesser of CPI (Consumer Price Index for Denver-Aurora-Lakewood) or 3% per year. Period.

**No vacancy decontrol.** This is the single most important provision. Most US "rent control" laws allow landlords to reset rent to market rate when a tenant moves out. This creates a perverse incentive to push tenants out. Under our plan, the cap follows the unit, not the tenant. If rent is $1,500 when one tenant leaves, the next tenant's rent starts at $1,500.

**Universal coverage.** Applies to ALL rental units in Denver, regardless of building age, size, or type. No exemptions for new construction (after a 15-year initial window to allow developers to recoup costs), no exemptions for single-unit landlords, no exemptions for luxury units.

**Just cause eviction.** Landlords can only evict for:
- Nonpayment of rent (with 30-day cure period)
- Material lease violation (with cure period)
- Owner move-in (verified, with relocation assistance)
- Building demolition/major renovation (with right of return at same rent + relocation assistance)
- Criminal activity on premises (conviction required, not mere allegation)

**Relocation assistance.** Any no-fault eviction (owner move-in, demolition, renovation) requires the landlord to pay 3 months' rent as relocation assistance.

**Enforcement.** Create a dedicated Rent Stabilization Office within the city, staffed with investigators who respond to tenant complaints, audit landlord filings, and impose penalties for violations. Penalties: $1,000-$10,000 per violation, treble damages to affected tenants.

**Commercial rent stabilization.** Extend protections to small business leases under 3,000 sq ft. Denver's small businesses — restaurants, bodegas, barbershops — are being displaced by the same forces displacing residents.

### Why No Vacancy Decontrol Matters

This is the policy detail that makes or breaks rent control. Here's why:

**With vacancy decontrol** (the weak model):
- Landlord has unit rented at $1,200
- Can only raise rent 3%/year while tenant stays
- Tenant leaves (or is pressured to leave)
- Landlord resets rent to $2,000 market rate
- **Result:** Landlords are incentivized to push tenants out

**Without vacancy decontrol** (our model):
- Landlord has unit rented at $1,200
- Can only raise rent 3%/year
- Tenant leaves
- New tenant's rent starts at $1,200 (or $1,236 with annual increase)
- **Result:** Landlords have zero incentive to push tenants out. Stability.

Every city that has implemented rent control with vacancy decontrol has seen it gutted over time. We won't make that mistake.

## How We Pay For It

Rent stabilization **costs the city almost nothing** to implement. It's a regulation, not a spending program.

- **Rent Stabilization Office:** $3-5M/year for staff, enforcement, and administration
- **Funded by:** Registration fees ($50-100/unit/year) paid by landlords. At 150,000+ rental units in Denver, this generates $7.5-15M/year — more than enough.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Won't rent control reduce housing supply?"**
The Stanford study that rent control opponents love to cite (Diamond et al., 2019) studied San Francisco's rent control *with vacancy decontrol*. Landlords converted rentals to condos to escape the cap. Our plan has no vacancy decontrol — removing that incentive entirely. Additionally, the most comprehensive meta-analyses show that well-designed rent control reduces displacement without reducing supply when paired with construction incentives.

**"Landlords will stop maintaining buildings."**
The act includes habitability enforcement and allows landlords to petition for above-cap increases specifically for capital improvements (new roof, new plumbing, etc.) — but not cosmetic upgrades. This is standard in functioning rent control systems worldwide.

**"This will hurt small landlords."**
A 3% annual increase is sustainable for any competently run rental property. If a landlord's business model requires 8-15% annual rent increases to work, that's not a sustainable business — it's speculation at tenants' expense. Additionally, the registration fee is minimal.

**"The state won't allow it."**
Colorado's rent control preemption is a political choice, not a constitutional one. We push for repeal at the state level while building the local coalition to implement immediately when preemption lifts. If necessary, we pursue a state ballot initiative.
