## The Problem

Colorado has 684,726 small businesses employing 1.2 million workers -- 49.6% of the state's private-sector workforce (SBA Office of Advocacy, 2023). Denver's small businesses are the backbone of our neighborhoods. But they are being crushed. The Colorado Restaurant Association reported a net loss of 222 restaurants in Denver between July 2022 and July 2023 -- more than 11% of the city's total. Before the pandemic, Denver saw 3-5% annual restaurant growth. From July 2023 to July 2024, another 183 restaurants closed. Colorado saw 3.4% of its small businesses permanently close in a single week during the pandemic -- worse than California (2.5%) or New York (2%). Statewide, business closures increased 17% in late 2022, even as new filings rose. The businesses closing are overwhelmingly local independents. The ones replacing them are chains.

Commercial rents are a primary driver of displacement. Average retail rents in Denver hit $24-26 per square foot in 2024, but premium neighborhoods tell a different story: Cherry Creek averages $46.50/SF. In RiNo, the central submarket had negative absorption -- tenants vacating 43,000 square feet in 2024 -- yet availability hit 8.1%, more than double the metro average of 3.9% (Bisnow, 2024). The paradox is clear: rents are too high for small businesses, but landlords would rather sit on empty storefronts than lower prices. On East Colfax, almost 40% of residents live in poverty while rents increased 12%. Five Points -- historically Denver's Black cultural center -- has seen massive displacement, with 68% of residents now renters at a median rent of $1,900. As one RiNo co-founder put it: "I've never seen gentrification at this speed."

The barriers to starting a business are stacked against small operators. Denver's building permits historically took over 300 days to process. Even after a 2025 overhaul establishing the Denver Permitting Office, the target is 180 days -- still six months of waiting before you can open your doors. Food businesses should plan 8-12 weeks for permits and inspections. Entrepreneurs must navigate multiple city departments, pay $75-$350 in licensing fees, and often hire consultants just to understand the process. Meanwhile, the racial wealth gap in business ownership is stark: only 1.4% of Denver-area businesses are Black-owned, despite Black residents making up 6% of the metro population. Only 7.4% of Colorado business owners identify as BIPOC (U.S. SBA). Black entrepreneurs start businesses with an average of $35,205 in capital -- one-third of the $106,720 available to white entrepreneurs. And 77% of small business owners who apply for a loan from a large bank are rejected. The system is designed for people who already have money.

### What Denver Currently Does

Denver Economic Development & Opportunity (DEDO) operates several programs: the Business Impact Opportunity (BIO) Fund, a pilot through Mile High United Way offering grants up to $5,000 for small businesses affected by construction or neighborhood change; a microloan program through CEDS Finance; and an interest-based small business loan program with loans up to $100,000. DEDO also runs a Murabahah (Islamic-compliant) financing program. The Division of Small Business Opportunity (DSBO) sets minority and women-owned business enterprise (MWBE) participation goals on city contracts -- typically around 7% -- and manages a Small Business Enterprise program with a 30% self-performance requirement.

These programs are real, but they are drastically underfunded relative to the scale of the problem. A $5,000 grant does not save a business facing a 20% rent increase. A 7% MWBE contracting goal does not close a racial wealth gap where Black business ownership is one-quarter what population share would predict. The 2025 Denver Permitting Office is a step forward, but 180 days is still too long. Colorado's state-level programs -- the CLIMBER loan fund, the Startup Loan Fund, the Small Business Accelerated Growth Program -- help, but they are spread thin across the entire state. Denver needs a local strategy with the scale and urgency this crisis demands.

## Our Solution

### 1. One-Stop Permitting & Business Startup
- Create a single city office for all business permits and licenses -- no more bouncing between 5+ departments
- 30-day maximum for standard business permits (the current 180-day target for building permits is unacceptable for small operators)
- Free permit assistance for businesses under $500K revenue -- navigating bureaucracy should not require a consultant
- Multilingual support in Spanish, Vietnamese, Amharic, Arabic, and Somali -- reflecting the communities that actually start small businesses in Denver
- Weekend and evening hours at permit offices -- entrepreneurs work day jobs while building businesses
- Digital-first processing with same-day confirmation for simple licenses

### 2. Commercial Rent Stabilization
- Cap commercial rent increases at CPI + 2% for small business tenants occupying spaces under 5,000 square feet
- Right of first refusal for small business tenants when their lease expires -- no more surprise displacement by chain tenants willing to pay premium rents
- Anti-displacement protections in rapidly gentrifying commercial corridors: RiNo, Five Points, East Colfax, Globeville, Elyria-Swansea, and Westwood
- Relocation assistance fund for small businesses when displacement is unavoidable -- covering moving costs, lease deposits, and lost revenue during transition
- Pair with anti-displacement housing policy for comprehensive neighborhood stabilization -- you cannot save businesses if their customers and workers are also being displaced

### 3. Worker Cooperative Ecosystem

Denver should not just incubate cooperatives -- it should build a full cooperative ecosystem, modeled on the most successful municipal programs in the country. The Democracy at Work Institute (DAWI) and the National League of Cities developed a [Municipal Playbook for Employee Ownership](https://institute.coop/topics/government-policy) that Denver should adopt as a framework.

**Cooperative Business Incubator**
- City-funded cooperative business incubator providing space, legal support, and startup capital for worker-owned businesses
- Technical assistance program: legal incorporation, financial management, democratic governance training, and ongoing mentorship for worker co-ops
- Shared back-office services (payroll, accounting, HR) for co-ops under 25 workers -- reducing administrative burden that kills small cooperatives
- Modeled on the Cleveland Evergreen Cooperatives (320 workers across multiple co-ops anchored by hospital and university purchasing) and the Preston Model (UK)

**Legacy Business Conversion Pipeline**
- This is the most urgent component. Nearly **50% of U.S. small businesses are owned by people at retirement age**, and 80% of them will be unable to find a buyer (DAWI, 2025). In Denver, that translates to thousands of businesses -- restaurants, shops, contractors, service providers -- at risk of closing permanently within the next decade. Employee buyouts preserve jobs, keep businesses local, and build worker wealth.
- **Conversion assistance program:** Help retiring small business owners sell their businesses to employees rather than to chains or private equity. The city provides: legal structuring for employee ownership trusts (EOTs) and worker cooperatives, financing through the micro-loan fund, and 18 months of transition mentorship.
- **Conversion tax incentive:** Property tax abatement for 3 years for businesses that convert to worker ownership. Revenue cost is minimal; alternative is business closure and vacant storefronts.
- **Annual outreach to businesses with owners aged 60+:** Proactive identification and engagement, not waiting for crisis.
- **Target: 50 legacy business conversions in the first 3 years.**

**Dedicated City Cooperative Liaison**
- A dedicated staff position within Denver Economic Development & Opportunity (DEDO) with cooperative development expertise -- modeled on Santa Ana, CA, which designated a City Liaison to remove barriers, identify incentives, and connect cooperatives to city programs
- The liaison coordinates across city departments: procurement, permitting, workforce development, and the cooperative incubator
- Annual cooperative economy report: number of co-ops, worker-owners, revenue, and sectors served -- published publicly

**Procurement Preferences**
- 5% bid preference on city procurement contracts for cooperatives -- putting public money behind democratic business models
- Anchor institution strategy: partner with Denver Health, DPS, Denver International Airport, and CU Denver to direct institutional purchasing toward local cooperatives -- the Cleveland Evergreen model, adapted for Denver's anchor institutions
- Break large institutional service contracts (laundry, food service, janitorial, landscaping) into cooperative-accessible lots

**Cooperative Finance**
- Dedicated cooperative loan fund within the [Bank of Denver](/platform/public-banking) (once established) -- cooperatives need patient capital with flexible terms that traditional banks do not provide
- Cooperative development grants: $10,000-$50,000 startup grants for new cooperatives, funded through the micro-loan revolving fund
- CDFI partnerships specifically for cooperative financing

### 4. Local-First City Procurement
- 10% bid preference for Denver-based businesses on all city contracts
- Break large contracts into smaller lots accessible to small businesses -- a $10M contract that only national firms can bid on should be ten $1M contracts
- Prompt payment mandate: city pays all invoices within 30 days (many cities and agencies routinely take 90+ days, which destroys small business cash flow)
- Targeted outreach to BIPOC-owned businesses for contract opportunities -- DSBO's current 7% MWBE goal should be a floor, not a ceiling
- Annual public reporting on procurement demographics: what percentage of city dollars goes to local businesses, BIPOC-owned businesses, small businesses, and cooperatives

### 5. Micro-Loan & Capital Access
- City-backed micro-loan fund for businesses under $250K revenue, offering 0-3% interest loans -- because 77% of small businesses are rejected by big banks
- Priority access for BIPOC, immigrant, and women-owned businesses -- closing the startup capital gap where Black entrepreneurs start with one-third the capital of white entrepreneurs
- Technical assistance paired with every loan: business planning, accounting, marketing, and legal support -- because capital alone is not enough (SBA data shows failure rates drop dramatically with mentorship and support)
- Shared commercial kitchen, maker space, and co-working facilities in underserved neighborhoods -- Montbello, Westwood, Sun Valley, and Globeville-Elyria-Swansea
- Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) partnerships to leverage federal funds and private capital alongside city investment

### 6. Anti-Monopoly & Local Competition
- Franchise and chain density limits in neighborhood commercial districts -- no more than 20% of ground-floor commercial space in a district can be occupied by formula businesses
- Formula business restrictions requiring special review for chains with 10+ locations seeking to open in designated neighborhood commercial zones
- Support for local business associations and business improvement districts with city matching funds
- "Shop Local" campaigns with measurable local spending multiplier data -- every $100 spent at a local business generates $45 in secondary local spending, compared to just $14 at a chain (Civic Economics; Institute for Local Self-Reliance)

### International Evidence: Cooperative Economics & Local Business

| Country/City | Model | Result |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| **Mondragon, Spain** | World's largest worker cooperative network. 260+ cooperatives across manufacturing, retail, finance, and agriculture. Democratic governance with pay ratios capped at 5:1. | 80,000+ workers. During Spain's 25%+ unemployment crisis, the Basque region kept jobless rates at half the national average. Not a single worker was fired in the 2008 recession. 97% cooperative survival rate over 30 years. |
| **Preston, UK** | Preston Model: redirected anchor institution procurement to local businesses. Community wealth building strategy launched in 2012 after collapse of a proposed shopping mall. | £74M redirected back into the Preston economy. Local procurement spend rose from 5% to 18.2%. 4,500 new jobs created. Unemployment fell from 6.5% to 3.1%. Named "Most Improved City in the UK" by PwC (2017). |
| **Cleveland, OH** | Evergreen Cooperatives: anchor institution procurement model linking hospitals and universities to local worker co-ops for laundry, food, and energy services. | 320 worker-owners across multiple cooperatives. Grew during COVID when other small businesses closed. Evergreen Cooperative Laundry tripled in size after landing Cleveland Clinic contract. Model replicated in cities across the US. |
| **Emilia Romagna, Italy** | Cooperative economy centered on Bologna. Two out of three residents are co-op members. Co-ops produce 30% of regional GDP. 85% of Bologna's social services delivered through co-ops. | Per capita income rose from 17th to 2nd among Italy's 20 regions. 50% higher than the national average. Lowest inequality levels in Italy. 5,681 active cooperatives in the region. |
| **Portland, OR** | Advance Portland: five-year inclusive economic development strategy (adopted 2023). Anti-Displacement Action Plan. TIF districts redirecting property tax increases to community investment. | Targeted investment in East Portland and Central City. Cully TIF district used as national model for equitable growth. Formula business restrictions in neighborhood districts. Explicit anti-displacement framework linking housing, transit, and economic development. |

The local spending multiplier is the most important number in economic development. Studies by Civic Economics and the Institute for Local Self-Reliance consistently find that 52.9% of each purchase at a local independent business recirculates in the local economy, compared to just 13.6% at chain stores. A study in Portland, Maine estimated that shifting just 10% of consumer spending from chains to local businesses would generate $127 million in additional local economic activity. The New Economics Foundation (UK) found that every ten pounds spent at a local food business was worth twenty-five pounds to the local economy, compared to fourteen pounds at a supermarket chain. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta found a strong correlation between higher shares of local small businesses and lower poverty rates. This is not a feel-good "shop local" message. It is economic math.

## How We Pay For It

- **One-stop permitting office:** $3-5M/year (offset by faster economic activity, increased permit fee revenue, and reduced bureaucratic overhead across multiple departments)
- **Cooperative incubator:** $2-3M/year (technical assistance, legal support, and shared facilities)
- **Micro-loan fund:** $10M initial capitalization as a revolving fund -- loans are repaid and re-lent, making the fund self-sustaining after Year 3
- **Local procurement preference:** Revenue-neutral -- this shifts existing city spending to local businesses, not new spending
- **Commercial rent stabilization:** Administrative costs only ($500K-1M/year for enforcement and mediation)
- **Total:** $15-20M initial investment, declining to $8-12M/year as the revolving loan fund matures
- **ROI:** Bartik's cost-benefit analysis of targeted small business development finds a return of 22% or higher when focused on locally owned businesses (W.E. Upjohn Institute). The local spending multiplier means every dollar shifted to local businesses generates 3-4x the local economic activity of that same dollar spent at a chain. Denver's Climate Protection Fund invests $40M/year. Our local economy deserves the same commitment.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Won't this hurt consumers with higher prices?"**
Local businesses are already price-competitive with chains in most categories. What chains offer in lower sticker prices, they extract in other ways: poverty wages that require public assistance, profits shipped to out-of-state headquarters, and tax avoidance strategies unavailable to local operators. When you account for the full cost -- including the 52.9% local recirculation rate versus 13.6% for chains -- local spending generates far more community value per dollar. Every $100 spent locally creates $45 in secondary local economic activity. The same $100 at a chain creates $14.

**"Commercial rent stabilization will discourage development."**
Developers are still profitable under CPI + 2% increases. What rent stabilization prevents is speculative rent-hiking designed to push out small tenants and replace them with chain tenants willing to pay above-market rates. RiNo's own vacancy data proves the problem: 8.1% availability -- double the metro average -- because landlords price out local businesses and then sit on empty storefronts waiting for a national tenant. Stabilization keeps storefronts active and neighborhoods vibrant.

**"Worker cooperatives are a niche model."**
Mondragon employs over 80,000 workers across 260+ cooperatives. In Emilia Romagna, Italy, two out of three residents are co-op members and cooperatives generate 30% of regional GDP. Cleveland's Evergreen Cooperatives tripled employment by linking to anchor institution procurement. The Preston Model created 4,500 jobs and was named Most Improved City in the UK. Cooperatives are proven at scale. What is "niche" is the assumption that the only way to run a business is with an owner extracting profit while workers have no stake.

**"The city shouldn't pick winners and losers."**
The city already picks winners and losers -- through zoning, tax incentives, infrastructure investment, and procurement. Right now, those tools overwhelmingly favor large corporations and out-of-state developers. Denver's Great Hall renovation at DIA ballooned from $650M to over $2B, with auditors finding the airport was not following procurement procedures. A 10% local bid preference and a cooperative incubator are modest interventions compared to the massive public subsidies already flowing to large firms. We are not picking winners. We are leveling a playing field that is currently tilted against local businesses.

**"Small businesses fail anyway -- why invest?"**
About 20% of small businesses fail in their first year, and 50% fail within five years (SBA, Bureau of Labor Statistics). But these numbers mask a critical finding: the primary drivers of failure are cash flow problems and lack of capital -- not bad ideas. A full 33% of failed businesses cite insufficient capital as the cause. When businesses receive both capital and technical assistance -- mentorship, accounting support, business planning -- failure rates drop dramatically. SCORE mentees, for example, have significantly higher survival rates than unassisted businesses. The question is not whether some businesses will fail. The question is whether we let a system that denies capital to BIPOC entrepreneurs, charges 300-day permit timelines, and allows unlimited rent increases continue to guarantee failure for the businesses our communities need most.
