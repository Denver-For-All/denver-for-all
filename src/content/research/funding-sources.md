# Funding Sources for DenverForAll.org

Research into funding sources, coalition partners, and strategic allies that support DenverForAll's policy research, civic tools, and organizing infrastructure.

## Our Funding Model

Denver For All has applied for fiscal hosting through [Open Source Collective](https://www.oscollective.org/) (OSC), a 501(c)(6) trade association. **We are currently awaiting manual verification** — our GitHub repository has fewer than 100 stars, so automated verification was not available. Once approved, this means:

- **Primary funding:** Grassroots donations through [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/denver-for-all)
- **Donations are not tax-deductible** — OSC is a 501(c)(6), not a 501(c)(3)
- **Not eligible for most foundation grants** — the vast majority of foundations and Colorado-specific grant programs require 501(c)(3) status or fiscal sponsorship through a 501(c)(3)
- **No gatekeepers** — we accept donations directly without application cycles or cohort waiting periods
- **Full transparency** — every dollar in and out is visible on the public ledger

This is a deliberate trade-off. We chose speed, independence, and radical transparency over grant eligibility. At our current operating scale ($200–800/month), grassroots donations cover all costs. If a specific grant opportunity ever warrants it, we can explore adding a 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsor alongside OSC.

See [open-collective-assessment.md](../../collateral/fiscal-sponsorship/open-collective-assessment.md) for implementation details and OpenCollective tier definitions.

## 501(c)(3) Fiscal Sponsors (If Needed Later)

Denver For All currently uses Open Source Collective (501(c)(6)) as its fiscal host. If a specific grant opportunity justifies it, the project could add a 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsor alongside OSC to unlock foundation grants and tax-deductible donations. This would be a significant step with added overhead and should only be pursued for a concrete, high-value opportunity.

### Tides Foundation
- **What:** One of the largest progressive fiscal sponsors; $1.4B+ in assets
- **Provides:** Grant management, HR, legal support
- **Fee:** ~9% of funds raised (varies by project size)
- **Why:** Maximum credibility with progressive foundations — many already flow money through Tides
- **Website:** [tides.org](https://www.tides.org/)

### Movement Strategy Center
- **What:** Incubates and accelerates transformative movements through fiscal sponsorship
- **Provides:** Strategic support alongside fiscal sponsorship — not just pass-through
- **Website:** [movementstrategy.org/fiscal-sponsorship](https://movementstrategy.org/fiscal-sponsorship/)

### Social Good Fund
- **What:** Based in Richmond, CA; sponsors hundreds of social justice projects
- **Fee:** 5–10%
- **Best for:** Smaller organizations getting started
- **Website:** socialgoodfund.org

## Current Status: Open Collective — Pending Verification

Denver For All has applied to [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/denver-for-all) with [Open Source Collective](https://www.oscollective.org/) as fiscal host. **Manual verification is pending** — automated verification requires 100+ GitHub stars, so we submitted a manual application. Once verified, donations and the public ledger will be fully active.

### Why This Model Works

- **Public real-time ledger** of every dollar — aligns with radical transparency values
- **10% fee** (comparable to traditional fiscal sponsors)
- **No gatekeepers** — no application cycles, no cohort waiting periods
- **$200–800/month** from small donors covers all ongoing research and operations
- **Independence** — no funder priorities to navigate, no reporting requirements beyond public transparency

### Trade-offs Accepted

- Donations are not tax-deductible (OSC is 501(c)(6), not 501(c)(3))
- Not eligible for most foundation grants (see reference sections above)
- Can add a 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsor later if a specific high-value grant opportunity justifies the overhead

### OpenCollective Tier Definitions

See the [Open Collective Assessment](../../collateral/fiscal-sponsorship/open-collective-assessment.md) for the full tier structure to configure in the OpenCollective dashboard.

### Ongoing Operations

1. Submit all expenses with receipts to the public ledger
2. Promote via newsletter, Reddit, Resistbot campaigns, and social channels
3. Build coalition relationships with partner organizations (no fiscal status required)
4. Publish monthly impact reports referencing the public ledger
