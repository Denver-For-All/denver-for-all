## Why MSC (In Addition to Social Good Fund)

MSC offers more strategic support than a pass-through fiscal sponsor:
- **Movement-building mentorship** alongside financial infrastructure
- **Just Transition framework** alignment with DenverForAll's economic justice focus
- **CDC Incubator model** specifically supports housing, land, and community development
- **Network access** to other movement organizations for coalition building

MSC onboards in cohorts, so this may take longer than Social Good Fund. Submit the inquiry now to get in the pipeline for the next cohort while Social Good Fund provides immediate fiscal sponsorship.

**Subject:** Fiscal Sponsorship Inquiry — Denver For All

Dear Daniel and the Movement Strategy Center team,

I'm writing to inquire about fiscal sponsorship for Denver For All (denverforall.org), a grassroots civic platform building power for working people in Denver, Colorado.

### Who We Are

Denver For All produces evidence-based policy research, builds free civic technology tools, and organizes tenants, workers, and communities to advance housing justice, economic equity, and government accountability. We are volunteer-run, 100% open source, and accept no corporate money.

### What We've Built

On a budget of under $840/year, we have created:

- **47 data-driven policy proposals** spanning housing, labor, healthcare, public safety, immigration, infrastructure, and democratic governance — each grounded in peer-reviewed research, international case studies, and Denver-specific data
- **8 free civic tools** including an eviction tracker, rent calculator, campaign finance transparency tracker, bilingual AI tenant rights chatbot, and nonpartisan candidate accountability trackers
- **6 federal grant templates** ready for city staff and advocates to file for HUD, FEMA, BEAD, and Safe Streets funding
- **A comprehensive organizing playbook** with grassroots outreach strategies across social media, community groups, Spanish-language communities, and direct action channels
- **Legislative analysis** classifying all 47 proposals by implementation pathway, with 10 identified as ready for immediate city council introduction

We reach approximately 600 unique visitors per week and are growing.

### Why MSC

We are drawn to MSC's fiscal sponsorship because of your commitment to movement infrastructure that goes beyond financial pass-through. Denver For All's work is deeply aligned with your Just Transition framework — we are building the research base, civic tools, and community power needed to shift Denver toward an economy that centers workers, tenants, and historically marginalized communities over corporate interests.

We are particularly interested in:
- **Model A (Comprehensive)** fiscal sponsorship for tax-deductible donations and foundation grant eligibility
- **The CDC Incubator model** given our focus on housing, community land trusts, and anti-displacement policy
- **Movement Strategy Network** connection to peer organizations doing similar work in other cities

### What Fiscal Sponsorship Unlocks

With fiscal sponsorship, Denver For All would:
1. Accept tax-deductible individual donations to fund AI-powered policy research, civic tool development, and bilingual access
2. Apply for foundation grants including the Denver Foundation Community Grants ($20K–$50K), Caring for Denver Foundation ($200K–$800K), and Fund for Housing and Opportunity ($50K–$140K)
3. Scale our organizing infrastructure for the 2027 Denver municipal election cycle
4. Deepen partnerships with Denver city council members, the mayor's office, the governor's office, and our federal delegation

### Our Values Alignment

- **BIPOC leadership and racial equity:** 30% of Denver's population is Hispanic/Latino; our platform is bilingual and our policy research centers displacement in communities of color
- **Anti-corporate:** We accept no corporate money and actively track corporate PAC influence on Denver politics
- **Open source and replicable:** All content is public domain, designed to be forked by movements in other cities
- **Systemic change:** Our proposals address root causes — public housing, sectoral bargaining, medical debt abolition, participatory budgeting — not band-aids

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how Denver For All fits within MSC's fiscal sponsorship program. I'm available for a call at your convenience.

Thank you for your work building movement infrastructure.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
Denver For All
