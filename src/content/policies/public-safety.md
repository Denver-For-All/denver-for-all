## The Problem

### Denver's Crime Reality

Denver has a crime problem, and the current approach isn't solving it. Violent crime surged during 2020-2022, and while it has declined from that peak, rates remain elevated above pre-pandemic levels. Property crime — particularly auto theft, catalytic converter theft, and package theft — remains a persistent concern that affects quality of life across the city. Denver recorded over 8,500 auto thefts in 2023, making it one of the highest per-capita auto theft cities in the country, though the number dropped from a peak of over 12,000 in 2022 (Denver Police Department UCR data).

Crime is not evenly distributed. Neighborhoods like Montbello, East Colfax, Five Points, and parts of the far northeast and southwest see disproportionate violent crime. These are the same neighborhoods with the highest poverty rates, lowest access to mental health services, most housing instability, and fewest youth programs. This is not coincidence — it is cause and effect.

### The Policing Paradox

Denver's police budget is approximately $300M/year (Denver Budget, 2024) — the largest single department expenditure. Despite consistent budget increases, crime rates have fluctuated independently of police spending. This is not unique to Denver: the Brennan Center for Justice found that police spending explains only 0-5% of variation in crime rates nationwide.

Denver police have killed residents, brutalized protesters (2020 George Floyd protests), and operated with minimal accountability. The current oversight structure lacks independence, subpoena power, or the ability to impose discipline. Officers who commit misconduct are rarely held accountable, and qualified immunity shields them from civil liability.

Meanwhile, police are dispatched to situations they're not trained for: mental health crises, homelessness, and substance use. The city has failed to invest in alternatives, and the result is that people in crisis encounter armed officers instead of mental health professionals. The STAR program receives approximately $6M — roughly 2% of the police budget — despite handling 10,000+ calls with zero incidents requiring police backup.

### What Actually Reduces Crime

Decades of research point to the same conclusion: crime is primarily driven by poverty, housing instability, lack of economic opportunity, untreated mental illness and substance use disorders, and the absence of community support systems — especially for young people. Policing responds to crime after it happens. Investment in communities prevents it from happening in the first place.

This is not theory. Cities that have invested heavily in community violence intervention, youth employment, mental health services, and housing stability have seen dramatic crime reductions — often outperforming cities that invested in policing alone. Oakland's GRYD program reduced shootings by 50% in target areas. Glasgow, Scotland cut its murder rate by 60% through public health intervention. Bogotá, Colombia reduced its homicide rate by 70% through urban investment, not militarized policing.

### What Denver Currently Does

Denver already has the Office of the Independent Monitor (OIM), created in 2004, which reviews police complaints and monitors investigations. However, the OIM cannot independently investigate, lacks subpoena power, cannot impose discipline, and serves in an advisory role. The Citizen Oversight Board exists but is appointed by the mayor (not independently elected) and also lacks enforcement authority. This structure has not prevented persistent misconduct: Denver paid $35.3M in law enforcement settlements from 2017-2023, with $17.3M in 2023 alone (Denver City Attorney records; Denver Post analysis, 2024).

The STAR program launched in 2020 and has handled 10,000+ calls with zero incidents requiring police backup (STAR Program Annual Report, 2023). It currently operates limited hours in limited areas. This is the most successful public safety innovation Denver has made in decades, and it is chronically underfunded.

### Who Opposes This (and Why)

The Denver Police Protective Association (DPPA) is the primary opponent. Police unions consistently oppose oversight with teeth, budget reductions, and qualified immunity reform. The DPPA donates to city council candidates and mayoral campaigns. The Downtown Denver Partnership and some business improvement districts will raise concerns about perceived safety impacts. Counter: the evidence from every city that has invested in non-police crisis response shows equal or better outcomes. STAR's own track record proves this.

## Our Solution

### 1. Independent Civilian Oversight Board
- Elected board (not mayoral appointees) with full subpoena power
- Authority to investigate complaints, access all records, and impose discipline
- Budget independent from police department
- Public hearings on use-of-force incidents
- Annual audit of police practices published publicly

### 2. STAR Program Expansion (Non-Police Crisis Response)
- 24/7 citywide coverage for mental health, substance use, and homelessness calls
- Mental health professionals and paramedics, without police
- Target: 40% of current 911 calls rerouted to non-police responders
- 911 dispatchers retrained to triage calls appropriately
- (See: Healthcare proposal for full STAR details)

### 3. Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) Expansion

STAR handles calls where police don't need to respond at all. But what about when officers *do* encounter someone committing a low-level offense — drug possession, sex work, trespassing, shoplifting driven by addiction? Right now, the default is arrest, booking, prosecution, and the revolving door of incarceration that solves nothing.

Denver piloted the LEAD program under Chief Paul Pazen, operating in DPD Districts 1, 2, and 6 with case management through Addiction Research and Treatment Services (ARTS) and the Empowerment Program. LEAD-trained officers redirect people to services instead of arresting them — voluntary, harm-reduction-based case management including housing, job training, substance use treatment, and mental health support. The pilot was funded at approximately $560K/year through state marijuana tax revenue, a fraction of what's needed for citywide impact.

The evidence is strong. Seattle's LEAD program — the original, launched in 2011 — showed participants had **58-60% lower odds of arrest** compared to controls, along with significant improvements in housing stability and employment (Collins et al., *Evaluation and Program Planning*, 2017). LEAD now operates in over 80 cities nationally. The National Institute of Justice rates it as an evidence-based program.

**Expand LEAD citywide:**
- LEAD-trained officers in every DPD district, not just Districts 1, 2, and 6
- Funding for dedicated LEAD case managers through community-based organizations (not DPD)
- Eligibility expanded beyond drug and prostitution offenses to include all low-level, nonviolent offenses driven by poverty, addiction, or mental health
- Data tracking: require demographic data on all LEAD referrals and declinations to monitor for racial disparities in who gets offered diversion vs. who gets arrested
- Target: 2,000+ annual diversions from arrest to services within 3 years

**Community-based referral pathways:** LEAD's national network has evolved — now branded "Let Everyone Advance with Dignity" — recognizing that police should not be the sole gatekeepers to diversion. Denver should develop parallel community referral pathways where outreach workers, business owners, and community members can connect people to LEAD case management directly, without police contact. This reduces the discretion gap where officer bias determines who gets a second chance and who gets a criminal record.

### 4. Budget Reallocation: 25% Redirect
Over 4 years, redirect 25% of police budget ($75M/year) to:
- STAR program expansion ($20M)
- Community violence intervention programs ($15M)
- Youth services and after-school programs ($15M)
- Substance use treatment and recovery ($10M)
- Restorative justice and LEAD diversion programs ($10M)
- Affordable housing (contributes to root cause reduction) ($5M)

### 5. End Qualified Immunity (City Level)
- Denver waives qualified immunity defense for all city employees, including police officers
- Officers can be held personally liable in civil suits for constitutional violations
- City provides legal defense only when officer followed policy and training
- Officers carry personal liability insurance (similar to doctors' malpractice insurance)

### 6. Use of Force Reforms
- Ban chokeholds and carotid restraints permanently
- Duty to intervene: officers must stop other officers' excessive force or face equal discipline
- Duty to report: failure to report excessive force is a firing offense
- De-escalation required before any use of force
- Body cameras mandatory and always on during encounters. Footage publicly accessible within 72 hours of any use-of-force incident

### 7. Community Violence Intervention
- Fund evidence-based violence intervention programs (Cure Violence model)
- Credible messengers from affected communities, not police
- Targeted intervention in highest-violence neighborhoods
- Hospital-based intervention for gunshot victims (prevent retaliation cycles)

### 8. Root-Cause Crime Reduction: The Denver Community Safety Investment

The single most effective crime reduction strategy is addressing the conditions that produce crime. This is not soft-on-crime idealism — it is what the evidence consistently shows works better than any policing strategy alone.

**Youth Opportunity & Violence Prevention:**
- **Summer and year-round youth employment guarantee** for all Denver residents aged 14-24 in high-crime neighborhoods. Youth employment programs reduce violent crime participation by 35-45% among participants (University of Chicago Crime Lab, READI Chicago evaluation). Cost: $15M/year. Return: incalculable
- **After-school and evening programming** in every neighborhood with above-average youth violence, open until 10 PM. Crime data consistently shows youth violence peaks between 3-10 PM on weekdays. Programs that fill this window reduce youth crime by 30-40% (Brookings Institution, 2022)
- **Mentorship programs** pairing at-risk youth with trained credible messengers from their own communities — people who have lived experience and community trust. Not Big Brothers Big Sisters (which works for different populations), but targeted intervention for youth at highest risk of violence involvement
- **Restorative justice in schools:** Replace school suspensions and expulsions (which push youth into the criminal legal system) with restorative practices. Denver Public Schools has piloted this — expand it citywide with dedicated funding

**Housing Stability = Safety:**
- Every 10% increase in housing instability correlates with a measurable increase in both property and violent crime (Desmond, *Evicted*, 2016; National Bureau of Economic Research). Denver's eviction crisis is a public safety crisis
- **Rapid rehousing for crime victims** who are displaced by violence, preventing the cycle of instability that leads to further victimization or retaliation
- **Housing support for returning citizens:** People leaving incarceration who receive stable housing within 30 days are 50% less likely to recidivate (Council of State Governments Justice Center). Denver should guarantee transitional housing for every returning citizen
- Cross-reference: [Social Housing](/platform/social-housing), [Housing First](/platform/housing-first), [Tenant Bill of Rights](/platform/tenant-bill-of-rights)

**Substance Use Treatment as Crime Reduction:**
- Property crime (shoplifting, auto theft, burglary) is overwhelmingly driven by substance use disorders and poverty, not by criminal disposition. Treating addiction reduces property crime more effectively than enforcement
- **On-demand treatment access:** No waitlists for substance use treatment in Denver. When someone is ready for treatment, the slot must exist that day. Current waitlists of weeks or months mean people continue using and continue offending
- **Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) expansion:** Ensure every Denver jail, hospital, and community health center offers MAT (methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone). MAT reduces opioid-related crime by 50-60% among participants (National Institute on Drug Abuse)
- Cross-reference: [Decriminalize & Heal](/platform/drug-policy)

**Environmental Design (CPTED):**
- **Lighting improvements** in high-crime corridors and public spaces. A randomized controlled trial in New York City found that improved street lighting reduced index crimes by 36% in public housing developments (NYU Furman Center, 2019)
- **Vacant lot remediation:** Philadelphia's vacant lot cleanup program reduced gun violence by 29% in surrounding areas (University of Pennsylvania, 2018). Denver has thousands of vacant and neglected lots
- **Natural surveillance:** Design public spaces, transit stops, and pedestrian corridors to maximize visibility and activity. Active, well-maintained public spaces deter crime; abandoned, dark spaces invite it
- **Community gardens and greening:** Urban greening programs consistently reduce crime in surrounding blocks (Kondo et al., 2016). This is not metaphor — visible community investment signals that someone cares about the space

**Focused Deterrence (for Serious Violent Crime):**
- **Group Violence Intervention (GVI)** / Operation Ceasefire model: Identify the small number of individuals and groups driving the majority of shootings and homicides. Offer them a choice: services and support (jobs, housing, treatment, mentoring) or focused law enforcement attention. This is not mass incarceration — it is precise intervention targeting the 0.5% of the population responsible for the majority of gun violence
- Oakland's Ceasefire program reduced homicides by 50%. Boston's original Ceasefire cut youth homicides by 63%. The evidence is among the strongest in all of criminology
- Denver should implement GVI through a partnership between the city, community organizations, and (reformed) law enforcement — with community organizations leading, not police

### 9. End Mass Surveillance Without Democratic Oversight

Denver's police department operates 111 Flock Safety automatic license plate reader (ALPR) cameras across nearly 70 intersections, photographing over 2 million vehicles per month. This mass surveillance infrastructure was deployed without a council vote, and when democratic accountability was finally exercised, it was overridden.

**What happened with Flock:**

- **May 2025:** Denver City Council voted **12-0** to reject a $666,000 two-year Flock contract extension, responding to massive community opposition.
- **August 2025:** Mayor Johnston bypassed the council by signing a **$498,509 contract**, structured deliberately to fall just under the $500,000 threshold that would require council approval. This was not an accident. It was a calculated end-run around democratic oversight.
- **October 2025:** The mayor extended the contract again through March 2026, this time at no cost to the city, another mechanism to avoid council review. Close to 700 people packed a town hall to protest. The majority of council members sent a letter to the city auditor asking him not to sign the agreement.
- **ICE data sharing:** Audit logs obtained through Colorado Open Records Act requests (which DPD and the mayor's office delayed releasing for over three months) revealed that Denver's Flock camera data had been searched **more than 1,400 times by ICE** since June 2024. This happened despite repeated assurances from the Johnston administration that no data was shared with immigration enforcement. Nationally, Flock's systems have been used by U.S. Border Patrol across over 82,000 cameras, and in one documented case a Texas sheriff's department used Flock to search across 83,000 cameras to locate a woman who had an abortion.
- **Councilwoman Flor Alvidrez** stated publicly: "I'm tired of seeing major public safety decisions made behind council's back."
- **At-large Councilmember Sarah Parady** called Flock "dishonest" and said she was "stunned" by the negotiations conducted without council involvement.

The Flock situation demonstrates exactly why Denver needs a surveillance technology oversight ordinance. When the mayor can deploy mass tracking systems without a vote, structure contracts to dodge review thresholds, and withhold audit logs showing federal immigration access to local data, the city's oversight structure has failed. (See: [Government Transparency & Digital Rights](/platform/government-transparency) for our full surveillance oversight proposal.)

Our demands:
- **Immediately deactivate** all Flock cameras until a full council vote authorizes their use with binding privacy safeguards
- **City council approval required** before any surveillance technology is acquired or deployed. No exceptions, no threshold manipulation
- **No ICE access** to any Denver surveillance data, with automatic contract termination and criminal referral for violations
- **ALPR data retention limited to 30 days** instead of indefinite mass tracking of Denver residents' movements
- **Public audit logs** for all surveillance data access, published monthly, with no three-month delays
- **Annual public hearings** on all active surveillance systems with community testimony

### International Evidence: Punishment Doesn't Work. Investment Does.

| Country | Model | Incarceration Rate | Recidivism | Result |
|---------|-------|-------------------|------------|--------|
| **Norway** | Rehabilitation-focused. Prisons resemble college campuses. Focus on reintegration: job training, education, therapy. Maximum sentence: 21 years. | 54 per 100K | **20%** | One of the lowest crime rates in the world. Prisoners come out as functioning citizens, not hardened criminals. |
| **Finland** | Open prisons where inmates work, attend school, go home on weekends. Focus on normality and skill-building. | 51 per 100K | **36%** | Crime has been declining for decades. Society saves money because fewer people return to prison. |
| **Germany** | Prisons run like vocational schools. Inmates learn trades, earn certifications, maintain family relationships. | 69 per 100K | **35-40%** | The goal is explicitly rehabilitation, not punishment. And it works for public safety and for inmates alike. |
| **Netherlands** | Closing prisons due to falling crime rates. Focus on electronic monitoring, community service, and rehabilitation. | 59 per 100K | **45%** | So few prisoners that they've actually shut down prisons and rented empty cells to Belgium and Norway. |
| **USA** | Punishment-focused. Overcrowded, violent, minimal rehabilitation. Private prison industry profits from incarceration. | **531 per 100K** (highest in the world) | **76%** | We lock up 10x more people than Norway, spend vastly more, and get vastly worse outcomes. Three-quarters of released prisoners return. The system does not produce safety; it produces repeat offenders. |

**The US incarceration rate is the highest on Earth**, exceeding Russia, China, and every authoritarian regime. And our recidivism rate proves it doesn't work. Norway rehabilitates 80% of its prisoners. We rehabilitate 24%.

### Evidence: Community Investment Reduces Crime

| City | Program | Result |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Oakland, CA** | Operation Ceasefire / Group Violence Intervention: identified individuals driving gun violence, offered services + focused enforcement. | Homicides dropped 50% (2012-2018). Shootings declined by similar margins. Most effective gun violence reduction program evaluated in the US. |
| **Glasgow, Scotland** | Violence Reduction Unit (2005): treated violence as a public health epidemic. Offered job training, mentoring, addiction treatment to those at highest risk. Worked with, not against, communities. | Murder rate dropped 60% over 10 years. Knife crime plummeted. Glasgow went from "murder capital of Europe" to a global model for violence reduction. |
| **Bogotá, Colombia** | Mayor Antanas Mockus (1995-2003): invested in public space, transit, education, culture. Restricted alcohol sales during peak violence hours. Community-based conflict resolution. | Homicide rate dropped 70%. From one of the most violent cities on Earth to a model of urban transformation — without militarized policing. |
| **Richmond, CA** | Office of Neighborhood Safety: city employees (not police) work directly with people most likely to shoot or be shot. Paid fellowships for participants who engage with services. | Gun homicides dropped 75% (2007-2019) in a city that tried everything else first. Cost: $3M/year. Savings in emergency healthcare, prosecution, and incarceration: many multiples. |
| **Philadelphia, PA** | Vacant lot remediation: cleaned up abandoned lots with grass, trees, fencing, and maintenance. Randomized controlled trial by University of Pennsylvania. | Gun violence dropped 29% in surrounding areas. Overall crime dropped significantly. Cost: minimal. Evidence quality: gold standard (RCT). |

Denver can't reform the state prison system alone, but Denver CAN:
- Redirect police budget to prevention and intervention
- Implement restorative justice that reduces incarceration
- End the police-to-prison pipeline for mental health crises and substance use
- Invest in youth employment, housing, treatment, and community infrastructure that prevents crime at its source
- Model what evidence-based public safety looks like for every city in America

## How We Pay For It

This is primarily a budget reallocation, not new spending. Moving $75M from police to services that address root causes costs the city $0 net.

- Civilian oversight board: $3-5M/year from general fund
- Youth employment guarantee (high-crime neighborhoods): $15M/year (from police budget reallocation)
- Expanded after-school/evening programming: $10M/year (from police budget reallocation + federal grants)
- On-demand substance use treatment: $8-12M/year (Medicaid reimbursement covers ~60%; city funds remainder)
- Environmental design (lighting, vacant lots, greening): $5-8M/year capital investment
- LEAD diversion program (citywide expansion): $3-5M/year (case managers, program coordination; partially offset by reduced booking/prosecution/incarceration costs)
- Group Violence Intervention program: $3-5M/year
- Returning citizen housing support: $5-8M/year (cross-funded with housing budget)

**The math on crime prevention:** A single homicide costs society approximately $1.5M in criminal justice, emergency healthcare, lost productivity, and community impact (National Institute of Justice, 2024). Preventing 20 homicides per year saves $30M. A single incarceration costs $40,000-60,000/year. Preventing 500 incarcerations through diversion saves $20-30M. Prevention is not just more humane — it is dramatically cheaper.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Won't reducing police funding increase crime?"**
Research by the Brennan Center for Justice (2020) found that increased police spending explains only 0-5% of the variation in crime rates. What does reduce crime: housing stability, employment, mental health treatment, youth services, and community investment. We're investing in what works.

**"Who responds to violent crime?"**
Police. This plan doesn't eliminate police. It refocuses them on violent crime and removes responsibilities they're not trained for. A smaller, better-trained, better-supervised police force focused on actual public safety threats.

**"Isn't ending qualified immunity too extreme?"**
Doctors carry malpractice insurance. Lawyers can be disbarred. Every profession except policing faces personal accountability for professional misconduct. This is not extreme; it's the baseline that every other profession already meets.

**"This sounds soft on crime."**
This is the opposite of soft on crime. "Tough on crime" has been US policy for 50 years, and we have the highest incarceration rate on Earth with recidivism rates above 75%. That is a policy that has failed by every metric. Our approach — evidence-based investment in what actually reduces crime — has produced 50-75% reductions in violence everywhere it has been properly implemented (Oakland, Glasgow, Bogotá, Richmond). Being serious about crime means following the evidence, not repeating failed strategies.

**"What about Denver's current crime trends?"**
Denver's crime data is mixed. Violent crime peaked in 2022 and has been declining. Property crime remains elevated, particularly auto theft. Neither trend correlates with police budget levels. Denver's police budget has increased consistently while crime rates have fluctuated independently. What does correlate with crime: housing instability, poverty, substance use, and lack of mental health services. That is exactly where we propose redirecting resources.

**"What about property crime specifically?"**
Property crime — especially auto theft and retail theft — is primarily driven by substance use disorders and poverty. You cannot arrest your way out of addiction. Denver's auto theft rate won't decline meaningfully until people have treatment access, stable housing, and economic alternatives. Our proposal to fund on-demand substance use treatment and housing support directly targets the conditions that drive property crime. Meanwhile, environmental design (better lighting, lot remediation) and focused deterrence address organized theft rings.

**"Don't Flock cameras reduce crime and recover stolen vehicles?"**
Denver attributed 352 arrests and 250 recovered vehicles to Flock cameras, but auto thefts dropped from 12,000 to 8,550 during a period when auto thefts declined nationally regardless of camera presence. Independent research finds no consistent evidence that ALPR camera networks reduce crime (Forbes, 2024). What Flock cameras verifiably do: photograph 2 million vehicles per month, create a mass tracking database of Denver residents' movements, and share that data with ICE over 1,400 times without public knowledge. The question is whether the marginal enforcement benefit justifies a surveillance system the city council unanimously rejected, the mayor imposed unilaterally, and ICE exploited for immigration enforcement in a sanctuary city.

**"Didn't Mayor Johnston add safeguards to the new Flock contract?"**
The October 2025 contract includes a $100,000 damages clause for Flock data breaches and memoranda of understanding restricting federal immigration access. But a legal expert flagged that the damages clause only applies when Flock is responsible for the breach, not when another agency misuses the data. More fundamentally: these safeguards were negotiated by the mayor's office behind closed doors, without council involvement, after the council voted 12-0 against the contract. The safeguards themselves are a concession that the surveillance was problematic from the start. The democratic failure lies in the process as much as the product.

**"Doesn't Denver already have civilian oversight?"**
Denver has the Office of the Independent Monitor (OIM, est. 2004) and a Citizen Oversight Board. Neither can independently investigate, subpoena records, or impose discipline. They are advisory bodies that review police self-investigations. This is not oversight; it is observation. Our proposal creates an elected board with actual enforcement power.
