## The Problem

Denver's racial wealth gap is not an accident. It was engineered by decades of deliberate government policy, and it persists because no government policy has ever attempted to repair it.

**Redlining.** The Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) maps from 1938 classified Denver neighborhoods by race. Five Points, Curtis Park, Whittier, and Cole, neighborhoods with Black and Latino residents, were marked "hazardous" (Grade D, red). Residents in these areas were systematically denied federally backed mortgages, FHA loans, and GI Bill benefits. White families in Park Hill, Hilltop, and Washington Park built generational wealth through subsidized homeownership. Black families in Five Points were locked out. The median white household in the Denver metro area now holds approximately $250,000 in wealth. The median Black household holds approximately $24,000, less than one-tenth (Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances, 2022; Prosperity Now Scorecard).

**Urban renewal and displacement.** In the 1950s and 1960s, Denver's urban renewal program demolished large sections of the Auraria neighborhood, displacing over 1,000 families, predominantly Hispanic and low-income, to build the Auraria Higher Education Center. The Skyline Urban Renewal Project razed 30 blocks of downtown, destroying the heart of Denver's Japanese American community and displacing hundreds of Black and Hispanic families. These were not natural market forces. They were government decisions to destroy communities of color for the benefit of institutions and developers.

**Globeville-Elyria-Swansea.** These neighborhoods, predominantly Latino, have endured a century of environmental racism: smelter contamination, ASARCO toxic waste, I-70 construction (which bulldozed through the neighborhood in the 1960s while wealthier, whiter communities successfully resisted freeway routing), and now the $1.3 billion I-70 expansion that added construction impacts to a community already carrying the heaviest pollution burden in Denver. Childhood blood lead levels in GES remain among the highest in the state (Denver Department of Public Health and Environment, 2023).

**Rocky Flats.** For nearly four decades, the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant 16 miles upwind of Denver produced plutonium triggers while contaminating soil, water, and air. Radiation monitoring was inadequate, waste was improperly stored, and fires in 1957 and 1969 released plutonium into the atmosphere. The site was raided by the FBI in 1989 and shut down. The surrounding area, now a "wildlife refuge," still contains plutonium in soil at levels that independent scientists dispute as safe. The communities most directly affected by Rocky Flats contamination are disproportionately lower-income and communities of color in Arvada, Westminster, and northwest Denver (Rocky Flats Right to Know Act advocacy; Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment).

**Ongoing segregation.** Denver remains deeply segregated by race and income. The dissimilarity index between Black and white residents is approximately 0.60, meaning 60% of Black residents would need to move to achieve an even distribution across the city (U.S. Census Bureau, 2020). Schools are more segregated now than in the 1990s. Life expectancy varies by 11 years across Denver neighborhoods, with the shortest lives in the poorest, most racially concentrated communities (Colorado Health Institute, 2022).

### What Denver Currently Does

Denver has no reparations program, no racial wealth gap commission, and no systematic effort to quantify or repair the harms described above.

- **Denver's Race and Social Justice Office:** Established in 2020, this office works on equity in city operations but has no reparations mandate, no budget for direct wealth transfer, and no authority to investigate historical harms.
- **Environmental justice:** The city has acknowledged environmental justice concerns in GES, but the I-70 expansion proceeded over community objections. Denver's lead remediation efforts are ongoing but severely underfunded relative to the scale of contamination.
- **Affordable housing programs:** HOST operates housing programs, but these are not framed as reparative and do not target communities specifically harmed by redlining and urban renewal.

## Our Solution

### Denver Reparations & Restorative Justice Commission

**1. Establish the Commission**
- City Council-created, 25-member commission. Composition: 15 community members from historically harmed communities (selected through open application with priority for affected neighborhoods), 5 subject-matter experts (historians, economists, public health researchers), and 5 council-appointed members.
- Two-year mandate to investigate, quantify, and recommend reparative actions for harms done to Black, Latino, Indigenous, and Asian American communities through specific Denver government policies and actions.
- Subpoena power to access city records, historical documents, and institutional data.
- Public hearings in every affected neighborhood: Five Points, Curtis Park, Whittier, Cole, Globeville, Elyria-Swansea, Auraria, Westwood, Montbello, and Sun Valley.

**2. Direct Reparative Programs**

Based on the Evanston model and adapted for Denver's specific history:

- **Homeownership grants:** $25,000 grants for down payments, mortgage principal reduction, or home repairs for Black residents who can establish residency in Denver during the redlining era (1938-1968) or are direct descendants. Funded through cannabis tax revenue (Evanston's model) and vacancy tax revenue.
- **Displacement repair fund:** Direct payments to families displaced by the Auraria urban renewal project, the Skyline project, and the I-70 construction and expansion. Research by the commission will identify eligible families and descendants.
- **Environmental health reparations for GES:** Comprehensive blood testing, healthcare coverage for contamination-related illness, and home remediation for lead and other toxins in Globeville-Elyria-Swansea. Payment for documented harm caused by city-approved industrial placement and highway construction decisions.
- **Business development grants:** $50,000 grants for Black, Latino, and Indigenous entrepreneurs in historically redlined neighborhoods, rebuilding the commercial ecosystems that redlining destroyed. Paired with technical assistance from the [Small Business & Local Economy](/platform/small-business-economy) cooperative incubator.

**3. Structural Reforms (Non-Cash)**

Reparations go beyond money. They require changing the systems that produced the harm.

- **Anti-displacement zones** in all historically redlined neighborhoods (cross-reference: [Anti-Displacement Zones](/platform/anti-displacement))
- **Community land trusts** seeded in Five Points, GES, Westwood, and Montbello to ensure permanent affordability in communities that have been displaced (cross-reference: [Community Land Trusts](/platform/community-land-trusts))
- **Naming and memorialization:** Rename public infrastructure to honor displaced communities. Install permanent memorials at Auraria, Skyline, and I-70 documenting the displacement.
- **Curriculum:** Partner with DPS to develop Denver-specific curriculum on redlining, urban renewal, and environmental racism, teaching the actual history of how Denver's neighborhoods were shaped.
- **Public apology:** Formal resolution by Denver City Council acknowledging the specific harms committed by city government against communities of color, with detailed findings from the commission.

**4. Guaranteed Income for Affected Communities**

Pair reparations with guaranteed income (see [Denver Guaranteed Income](/platform/guaranteed-income)) targeted at residents of historically redlined neighborhoods. This addresses the ongoing economic harm of the racial wealth gap, beyond specific historical incidents.

### Evidence: Cities Are Acting

| City | Program | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Evanston, IL** | First US city to disburse publicly funded reparations. $25,000 housing grants to Black residents with ties to 1919-1969 era. Funded by cannabis tax. | $6.2 million disbursed as of mid-2025. 132 of 141 "Ancestor" recipients paid. Expanding to business reparations for Black-owned businesses harmed by gentrification. |
| **Asheville, NC** | Reparations Commission (25 members, appointed 2022). Recommended guaranteed income for Black residents harmed by wage discrimination, plus a Black-led Economic Development Center. | Recommendations adopted. Implementation in progress. |
| **San Francisco, CA** | Board of Supervisors created a reparations fund (11-0 vote). Advisory committee recommended $5 million lump-sum payments to eligible Black residents. | Fund created but unfunded due to $1 billion city deficit. Demonstrates political will even without immediate fiscal capacity. |
| **Detroit, MI** | Reparations task force established 2023. | Studying historical harms including urban renewal, highway construction, and redlining. |
| **St. Paul, MN** | Reparations commission studying harms to Black residents from Rondo neighborhood destruction (I-94 construction). | Parallels to Denver's I-70 destruction of GES. |

The pattern is consistent: cities with specific, documented histories of racial harm are creating commissions, investigating, and acting. Denver's history of redlining, urban renewal, and environmental racism is as well-documented as any city in the country. What Denver lacks is not evidence. It is political will.

### Denver-Specific Historical Documentation

The evidentiary foundation already exists:

- **HOLC redlining maps for Denver (1938):** Digitized and publicly available through the Mapping Inequality project (University of Richmond). Five Points, Curtis Park, Whittier, and Cole clearly marked as Grade D ("hazardous") based explicitly on racial composition.
- **Auraria urban renewal records:** Denver Public Library Western History Collection contains displacement documentation, property condemnation records, and community testimony.
- **I-70 construction and expansion environmental impact statements:** Federal Highway Administration records document the routing decision and community impact.
- **ASARCO/Globeville contamination:** EPA Superfund records, CDPHE blood lead data, and Denver Department of Public Health reports.
- **Census and wealth data:** Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances, American Community Survey, Prosperity Now Scorecard all document the current racial wealth gap by metro area.

The commission does not need to start from scratch. The evidence is abundant. What it needs is the authority and mandate to compile it, quantify the harm, and recommend action.

## How We Pay For It

- **Commission operations:** $2-3M over the two-year investigation period (staff, research, public hearings, travel)
- **Homeownership grants:** $25M initially (1,000 grants x $25,000), scaling based on commission recommendations. Funded through:
  - Cannabis tax revenue: Colorado's cannabis tax generated $423M statewide in 2023. Evanston's model dedicates its 3% municipal cannabis tax to reparations. Denver can allocate a portion of its local cannabis tax share.
  - Vacancy tax revenue (see [Vacancy Tax](/platform/vacancy-tax))
  - Federal community development block grant (CDBG) funds, where eligible
- **Displacement repair fund:** Commission will determine scale based on identified families. Estimated $10-20M.
- **Environmental health reparations (GES):** $5-10M/year, partially recoverable from responsible parties (ASARCO settlement funds, federal highway mitigation funds)
- **Business development grants:** $5M/year from the micro-loan and cooperative incubator programs (see [Small Business & Local Economy](/platform/small-business-economy))
- **Total estimated cost: $50-75M over 5 years**, funded through dedicated revenue streams. Evanston has disbursed $6.2M from a city of 78,000 people. Denver, with a population of 715,000 and a general fund budget of $1.8 billion, has significantly greater fiscal capacity.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Reparations are divisive."**
Ignoring the harm is what created the division. Denver's racial wealth gap, where Black households hold one-tenth the wealth of white households, exists because of specific government policies: redlining, urban renewal, highway routing, and environmental racism. Acknowledging that history and taking action to repair it is not divisive. Pretending it didn't happen while the consequences persist is.

**"Why should today's residents pay for historical wrongs?"**
Because today's residents benefit from historical wrongs. The wealth gap created by redlining compounds with every generation. White families in Park Hill and Washington Park built equity in homes purchased with FHA loans that were systematically denied to Black families in Five Points. That equity funded college educations, business startups, and down payments for the next generation. The harm is not historical; it is ongoing. And public reparations are funded through broad-based revenue (cannabis tax, vacancy tax), not individual assessments.

**"Evanston's program has been sued."**
Yes, by the Judicial Watch, a conservative legal organization that opposes any race-conscious government program. The lawsuit argues that race-targeted benefits violate the Equal Protection Clause. Courts have not yet resolved this question definitively. Denver's program can be structured to survive legal challenge by: (1) basing eligibility on residency in specific neighborhoods during specific time periods (geographic and temporal criteria, not solely racial); (2) documenting the specific government actions that caused harm; and (3) narrowly tailoring remedies to the documented harm. The commission's investigative work provides the evidentiary foundation for legally defensible reparative programs.

**"This is too expensive."**
Denver spent $1.3 billion on the I-70 expansion through the same neighborhoods it displaced. The city's general fund exceeds $1.8 billion per year. Reparations estimated at $50-75M over five years represent approximately 0.8% of the city's five-year budget. The question is not cost. It is priorities.

**"What about other groups that have experienced discrimination?"**
This proposal specifically names Black, Latino, Indigenous, and Asian American communities because Denver's documented harms (redlining, Auraria displacement, I-70 routing, Skyline demolition, and environmental contamination) affected these specific communities through specific government actions. The commission's mandate is to investigate Denver-specific harms and recommend Denver-specific remedies. This does not preclude future action for other communities. It is a starting point, not a ceiling.
