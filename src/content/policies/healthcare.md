## The Problem

A single hospital stay in Denver can produce a bill of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Medical debt is a leading contributor to bankruptcy in America (Himmelstein et al., 2009; Dobkin et al., 2018 -- see FAQ for discussion of methodology). Denver Health, a public hospital, still sends patients to collections and places liens on homes. The system generates debt, not health.

Meanwhile:
- Denver has insufficient mental health crisis services - police respond to mental health emergencies they're not trained for, with predictable results
- Entire neighborhoods lack accessible primary care
- Prescription drugs cost 2-10x what they cost in other countries (RAND Corporation, 2021)
- Uninsured and underinsured residents delay care until emergencies, which costs everyone more

### What Denver Currently Does

Denver Health is a public safety-net hospital, but it still sends patients to collections and places liens on homes. The STAR program (Support Team Assisted Response) launched in 2020 as a non-police mental health crisis response -- it has handled 10,000+ calls with zero incidents requiring police backup (STAR Annual Report, 2023), but operates limited hours in limited areas with approximately $6M in funding. Denver has 9 Federally Qualified Health Centers (Clinica Tepeyac, Salud Family Health, Denver Health community centers, etc.) but significant coverage gaps remain in Montbello, Green Valley Ranch, and other underserved areas. Colorado expanded Medicaid under the ACA and has ~7.5% uninsured (Census ACS, 2023), but underinsurance remains a major issue.

## Our Solution

### 1. Denver Medical Debt Forgiveness Program
- City purchases medical debt portfolios at pennies on the dollar (debt buyers typically pay 1-5 cents per dollar of debt)
- Cancel all purchased debt - no strings attached
- Estimated cost: $5M in city funds can forgive $100-500M in medical debt
- Partner with RIP Medical Debt (now Undue Medical Debt) for execution
- Ongoing program funded by hospital impact fees

### 2. Hospital Cost Transparency Act
- All Denver hospitals must publish real prices (not chargemaster fiction) for the 200 most common procedures
- Itemized bills required within 30 days - no more surprise charges appearing months later
- Price variation reports published by the city quarterly
- Penalties for price gouging: defined as charging uninsured patients more than 200% of Medicare rates

### 3. STAR Program (Support Team Assisted Response)
Denver already has a nascent STAR program. We expand it dramatically:
- 24/7 coverage citywide (currently limited hours and areas)
- Mental health professionals + paramedics respond to mental health crises, substance use incidents, homelessness calls, and welfare checks
- Police are NOT dispatched for non-violent mental health calls
- Target: 75% of current "mental health" police calls redirected to STAR
- Funding: Redirect 15% of police overtime budget to STAR expansion

### 4. Community Health Centers
- Federally Qualified Health Center in every Denver neighborhood (currently significant gaps in low-income areas)
- Sliding-scale fees based on income
- Primary care, dental, vision, mental health, and substance use treatment
- Prescription drug purchasing cooperative - Denver negotiates drug prices collectively for uninsured residents

### 5. Reproductive Healthcare Protection
- Denver as a sanctuary city for reproductive healthcare access
- City-funded reproductive healthcare for uninsured residents
- Buffer zones around clinics
- Non-cooperation with states criminalizing reproductive healthcare

### International Evidence: We Pay More and Get Less

| Country | Model | Cost per Capita | Life Expectancy | Medical Bankruptcies |
|---------|-------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Germany** | All-payer rate setting - all insurers pay same negotiated rates. No surprise billing. | $7,383 | 81.4 years | 0 |
| **Japan** | Government reference pricing for all procedures. | $4,691 | 84.8 years | 0 |
| **Taiwan** | Single-payer since 1995. Smart card system. | $3,047 | 80.9 years | 0 |
| **UK (NHS)** | Government-run. Free at point of use. | $5,138 | 81.4 years | 0 |
| **France** | Universal multi-payer. Government covers 70-100% of costs. | $5,564 | 82.5 years | 0 |
| **USA** | Market-based. Unregulated pricing. | **$12,555** | **77.5 years** | **530,000/year** |

**We pay the most and live the shortest.** The US spends twice what Germany spends per person and gets 4 fewer years of life expectancy and half a million bankruptcies. A child's NICU stay costs a family $0 in Germany. In Denver, it can cost millions.

Denver can't implement single-payer unilaterally, but Denver CAN model what humane healthcare looks like: forgive debt, create transparency, expand community health, and replace police crisis response with medical professionals.

**Denver For All also supports Colorado state legislation for all-payer rate setting** (the German model) - requiring all insurers and hospitals to negotiate standard rates, eliminating surprise billing and the administrative waste that consumes 30% of US healthcare spending.

## How We Pay For It

- Medical Debt Program: $5M/year (forgives $100-500M)
- STAR Expansion: Redirected from police budget ($15-20M)
- Community Health Centers: Federal HRSA matching funds + city investment ($10M)
- Total city investment: ~$30-35M/year, offset by reduced emergency room utilization, reduced police costs, and improved public health outcomes

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Why should the city forgive medical debt? People chose to go to the hospital."**
People don't choose to get sick or injured. A child's cancer treatment shouldn't bankrupt a family. And the debt is sold to collectors for pennies anyway - the hospital has already written it off. This program costs the city very little and changes thousands of lives.

**"Isn't healthcare a federal issue?"**
Federal solutions aren't coming soon enough. Cities can act now - on mental health crisis response, on debt forgiveness, on community health centers, on drug pricing. We don't wait for Congress to stop our neighbors from dying.

**"How does this interact with the ACA and Medicaid expansion?"**
Colorado expanded Medicaid and runs Connect for Health Colorado, its ACA marketplace. These programs help the insured access care. Our proposals address what they don't: medical debt for the insured (high deductibles and copays still bankrupt people), non-police crisis response, community health center gaps, and drug pricing for the uninsured and underinsured. This supplements state and federal programs, not duplicates them.

**"Is medical debt really the leading cause of bankruptcy?"**
The commonly cited claim (Himmelstein et al., 2009, American Journal of Medicine: 62% of bankruptcies) has been debated. A 2018 study by Dobkin et al. in the American Economic Review found the effect was smaller but still significant: hospital admissions increase unpaid medical bills, reduce earnings by 20%, and raise bankruptcy risk, with uninsured non-elderly adults experiencing a 1.4 percentage point increase in bankruptcy over four years. Either way, medical debt is a leading contributor to financial catastrophe, and the US is the only wealthy country where this happens at all.
