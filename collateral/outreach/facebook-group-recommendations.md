## Category 1: General Denver Community Groups

### Denver Community Forum / Denver Colorado Community
- **Estimated size:** 50,000-100,000+ members (Denver's largest general community groups)
- **Tier:** 1 (high-activity, issue-aligned)
- **Primary policy alignment:** Housing costs, cost of living, public safety, infrastructure, broadband — basically everything. General groups surface whatever is bothering people right now.
- **Entry strategy:** These groups are full of people venting about rent, Comcast, potholes, and crime. Your first comments should be data-backed responses to those complaints — not policy pitches. Someone complains about a rent increase? Drop the CRS 38-12-301 fact and the 85% increase since 2010. Someone complains about internet? Mention the 2018 ballot measure and Longmont's $50/month gigabit.
- **Tool to share:** Rent calculator (when housing threads appear), sidewalk data explorer (when infrastructure threads appear)
- **Lurk period notes:** Watch for recurring complaint themes. Track which posts get the most engagement. Identify the regular posters and group norms — some of these groups have no-politics rules that may limit direct policy discussion. Note which admins are active and how they handle political content.

**Search terms:** `Denver community`, `Denver Colorado`, `Denver discussion`, `Denver neighbors`

### Denver Politics / Denver Political Discussion
- **Estimated size:** 5,000-20,000 members
- **Tier:** 1 (high-activity, issue-aligned)
- **Primary policy alignment:** All policies — this is where explicitly political discussion is welcome
- **Entry strategy:** These groups expect substantive policy debate. Lead with data drops: the eviction filing numbers, the broadband voter mandate, the STAR program evaluation. You can be more directly political here than in general community groups. Still lead with data, not the organization.
- **Tool to share:** Follow the Money campaign finance tool, council candidate tracker
- **Lurk period notes:** Identify the ideological range of the group. Is it progressive-leaning, mixed, or libertarian-heavy? Each requires a different framing. Watch for which local officials and candidates get discussed — that's your opening for the candidate tracker.

**Search terms:** `Denver politics`, `Denver political discussion`, `Colorado politics Denver`

## Category 2: Renter and Housing Groups

### Denver Renters / Denver Tenant Groups
- **Estimated size:** 2,000-15,000 members
- **Tier:** 1 (high-activity, issue-aligned)
- **Primary policy alignment:** Rent stabilization, tenant bill of rights, eviction protections, social housing, housing first
- **Entry strategy:** This is the single highest-alignment audience for Denver For All's housing policies. People here are asking about lease terms, complaining about landlords, sharing eviction horror stories. Be the person who knows the law: CRS 38-12-301 (no rent stabilization), 60-day notice requirement, habitability rights. The eviction tracker and know-your-rights chatbot are genuinely useful to people in these groups — share them when directly relevant.
- **Tool to share:** Eviction tracker (primary), know-your-rights AI chatbot, rent calculator
- **Lurk period notes:** Pay attention to the most common complaints. Are they about rent increases, security deposits, maintenance issues, or eviction threats? Each maps to a different policy. Track whether the group allows resource sharing — many renter groups explicitly welcome it.

**Search terms:** `Denver renters`, `Denver tenants`, `Denver housing`, `Denver apartments`, `renting in Denver`

### Denver Housing Search / Denver Apartments for Rent
- **Estimated size:** 10,000-50,000+ members
- **Tier:** 2 (high-activity, indirectly aligned)
- **Primary policy alignment:** Rent stabilization, social housing, vacancy tax
- **Entry strategy:** These are transactional groups — people looking for housing. Policy engagement happens in the comments when someone expresses shock at prices. Wait for the "is $2,000 normal for a 1BR?" posts and respond with Denver-specific rent data and the CRS 38-12-301 context. Don't lead with policy proposals in housing search groups — it reads as spam.
- **Tool to share:** Rent calculator (shows whether a listing is above/below area median)
- **Lurk period notes:** Note the most common price ranges posted. This is real-time market data you can reference in other channels.

**Search terms:** `Denver apartments`, `Denver housing search`, `Denver rooms for rent`, `Denver roommates`

## Category 3: Parent and Family Groups

### Denver Parents / Denver Moms / Denver Families
- **Estimated size:** 10,000-50,000+ members (parent groups tend to be very large and active)
- **Tier:** 1 (high-activity, issue-aligned)
- **Primary policy alignment:** Universal childcare ($2,200/month costs, CCCAP gaps, 15hr/week Pre-K limitation), living wage ($7/hr gap for families), education, maternal-infant health, parks & recreation
- **Entry strategy:** Childcare cost is the universal pain point. When someone posts about daycare costs or waitlists, respond with the EPI data ($16,800-26,400/year — more than CU Boulder tuition), the CCCAP coverage gaps, and the Quebec model ($7/day, paid for itself through increased tax revenue). The tone here should be empathetic parent, not policy wonk.
- **Tool to share:** Rent calculator (cost-of-living context), know-your-rights chatbot (tenant rights for families facing displacement)
- **Lurk period notes:** Track the most common childcare complaints: cost, waitlists, quality, hours, infant care gaps (6 months to 3 years is the desert). These are all addressed in the universal childcare policy. Also watch for school quality discussions — that's an education policy entry point.

**Search terms:** `Denver parents`, `Denver moms`, `Denver dads`, `Denver families`, `Denver moms group`, `Denver parenting`

## Category 4: Neighborhood-Specific Groups

### High Displacement: Globeville / Elyria-Swansea
- **Estimated size:** 1,000-5,000 members
- **Tier:** 2 (neighborhood-specific)
- **Primary policy alignment:** Anti-displacement zones, social housing, community land trusts, immigration sanctuary/protection (high Latino population), pedestrian infrastructure (I-70 reconstruction impact)
- **Entry strategy:** These neighborhoods have been gutted by I-70 reconstruction, industrial pollution, and gentrification. Residents are deeply skeptical of outside organizations. Your entry must be hyperlocal: reference specific GES issues (air quality, Suncor, I-70, displacement). Share data about what's happening to their neighborhood specifically. Clinica Tepeyac and Focus Points Family Resource Center are trusted organizations here — be aware of their work and don't duplicate it.
- **Tool to share:** Sidewalk data explorer (GES has major pedestrian infrastructure gaps), eviction tracker
- **Lurk period notes:** Understand the I-70 history. These residents have been promised things by city hall for decades and gotten screwed. Do not show up with "here's what we think Denver should do." Show up with data about what's been done TO this neighborhood.

**Search terms:** `Globeville Elyria-Swansea`, `GES Denver`, `Globeville community`, `Elyria-Swansea neighbors`

### High Displacement: RiNo / Five Points
- **Estimated size:** 2,000-10,000 members
- **Tier:** 2 (neighborhood-specific)
- **Primary policy alignment:** Anti-displacement, social housing, corporate landlord ban, vacancy tax (high concentration of investor-owned properties), arts & culture (RiNo arts displacement)
- **Entry strategy:** RiNo and Five Points are ground zero for Denver gentrification. The audience here splits between newer residents (who may not realize the displacement history) and longtime residents (who are living it). For newer residents, the data on corporate landlord consolidation and vacancy rates is eye-opening. For longtime residents, the anti-displacement and social housing policies speak directly to their experience.
- **Tool to share:** Eviction tracker, rent calculator
- **Lurk period notes:** Watch for development-related threads (new luxury buildings, small business displacement, parking/traffic complaints from construction). These are natural pivot points to anti-displacement and social housing data.

**Search terms:** `RiNo Denver`, `Five Points Denver`, `River North Denver`, `Five Points community`

### High Renter Density: Capitol Hill / Baker
- **Estimated size:** 5,000-15,000 members (Capitol Hill groups tend to be large and active)
- **Tier:** 2 (neighborhood-specific)
- **Primary policy alignment:** Rent stabilization, tenant bill of rights, eviction protections, pedestrian infrastructure, transportation/transit, STAR program (high density of mental health crisis calls)
- **Entry strategy:** Capitol Hill has the highest renter density in Denver. Rent complaints, landlord issues, and noise/safety concerns dominate. The rent stabilization and tenant bill of rights data are tailor-made for this audience. Pedestrian infrastructure is also huge — Capitol Hill is one of the most walkable neighborhoods and residents care about sidewalks, crosswalks, and bike lanes.
- **Tool to share:** Rent calculator, know-your-rights chatbot, sidewalk data explorer
- **Lurk period notes:** Capitol Hill groups tend to be younger and more politically engaged than average. Policy discussion is often welcome. Note the transit discussions — these feed into the transportation policy.

**Search terms:** `Capitol Hill Denver`, `Cap Hill Denver`, `Baker neighborhood Denver`, `Capitol Hill community`

### Underserved: Montbello / Green Valley Ranch / Far Northeast Denver
- **Estimated size:** 2,000-8,000 members
- **Tier:** 2 (neighborhood-specific)
- **Primary policy alignment:** Healthcare (healthcare deserts), municipal broadband (underserved by ISPs), public safety (community violence intervention), youth services, food access, parks & recreation
- **Entry strategy:** These neighborhoods are underserved in nearly every dimension: healthcare access, broadband, transit, grocery stores, youth programs. The entry angle is service gaps, not ideology. "Did you know Denver voted for municipal broadband in 2018 and your neighborhood still doesn't have it?" lands differently when the neighborhood has been redlined by Comcast for decades.
- **Tool to share:** Sidewalk data explorer (far northeast has major gaps), eviction tracker
- **Lurk period notes:** These communities often feel ignored by city hall and by advocacy organizations that focus on central Denver. Showing up with data about their specific neighborhood — not generic Denver data — builds trust. Watch for healthcare access complaints (nearest ER, clinic availability) and food access discussions.

**Search terms:** `Montbello Denver`, `Green Valley Ranch Denver`, `GVR community`, `Far Northeast Denver`, `Northeast Denver community`

### Bilingual Communities: Westwood / Athmar Park / Southwest Denver
- **Estimated size:** 1,000-5,000 members (some groups operate primarily in Spanish)
- **Tier:** 2 (neighborhood-specific)
- **Primary policy alignment:** Immigration sanctuary/protection, living wage, universal childcare, healthcare, pedestrian infrastructure, food access
- **Entry strategy:** Many groups in these neighborhoods operate bilingually or primarily in Spanish. Do NOT engage in English-only if the group is Spanish-dominant. Wait until Spanish-language policy content is available (at minimum the policy summaries, which are already translated). Reference Centro Humanitario and Mi Casa Resource Center as organizations residents already trust. Lead with immigration protections (SB26-005, sanctuary policies) and living wage — these are the most immediately resonant issues.
- **Tool to share:** Know-your-rights chatbot (bilingual), eviction tracker
- **Lurk period notes:** Understand the community dynamics. Many residents in these neighborhoods are mixed-status families. Immigration enforcement is not abstract — it's a daily concern. Watch for ICE-related posts, which are natural entry points for the sanctuary and Flock surveillance data (1,400+ ICE searches).

**Search terms:** `Westwood Denver`, `Athmar Park Denver`, `Southwest Denver`, `Denver Latino community`, `comunidad Denver`, `vecinos de Denver`

## Category 5: Worker and Professional Groups

### Denver Service Industry / Restaurant Workers
- **Estimated size:** 2,000-10,000 members
- **Tier:** 3 (professional/identity-based)
- **Primary policy alignment:** Living wage ($7/hr gap), one fair wage (tipped minimum wage elimination), paid leave, right to disconnect, gig worker protections
- **Entry strategy:** Service workers are the most directly affected by wage policies. The Denmark comparison ($22/hr for fast food workers, Big Mac costs 80 cents more) and the fact that 7 states eliminated the tipped minimum with no restaurant industry collapse are powerful data points. But start by being helpful: answer questions about labor rights, share information about wage theft reporting, and build credibility before introducing policy.
- **Tool to share:** Know-your-rights chatbot (can answer labor rights questions)
- **Lurk period notes:** Watch for wage theft complaints, scheduling abuse stories, and tipping policy discussions. These are all direct entry points. Note whether the group is more front-of-house (tipping discussions) or back-of-house (wage and conditions focus) — the framing differs.

**Search terms:** `Denver restaurant workers`, `Denver service industry`, `Denver bartenders`, `Denver food service`, `Denver hospitality workers`

### Denver Teachers / Education Workers
- **Estimated size:** 1,000-5,000 members
- **Tier:** 3 (professional/identity-based)
- **Primary policy alignment:** Education, universal childcare (childcare workers earn $13-16/hr vs. teachers), living wage, works councils, paid leave
- **Entry strategy:** Denver teachers have recent strike history and are politically engaged. The childcare worker pay comparison ($13-16/hr for the people responsible for the most critical developmental stage) resonates with educators who understand child development. DPS budget and school quality discussions are natural entry points.
- **Tool to share:** Follow the Money (education budget tracking), candidate tracker
- **Lurk period notes:** Track DPS board meeting discussions, budget concerns, and staffing shortage complaints. These all connect to education and wage policies.

**Search terms:** `Denver teachers`, `DPS teachers`, `Denver education`, `Colorado teachers Denver`

### Denver Small Business Owners
- **Estimated size:** 2,000-10,000 members
- **Tier:** 3 (professional/identity-based)
- **Primary policy alignment:** Small business economy, municipal broadband (Comcast costs), living wage (framed as consumer purchasing power), public banking
- **Entry strategy:** Small business owners are often skeptical of wage mandates and regulation. The entry here is through shared frustrations: Comcast monopoly pricing, commercial rent increases, difficulty competing with corporate chains. The small business policy specifically addresses these concerns. The broadband policy ($30/month vs. $80-120/month) is a direct cost savings pitch. Frame living wage as "your customers having money to spend at your business."
- **Tool to share:** Follow the Money (track which corporations are buying political influence)
- **Lurk period notes:** Watch for Comcast complaints (broadband entry point), commercial lease horror stories (anti-displacement angle), and discussions about competing with chains (corporate landlord ban, small business protections). Avoid leading with wage mandates in this group — build trust on shared concerns first.

**Search terms:** `Denver small business`, `Denver entrepreneurs`, `Denver small business owners`, `Denver business community`

## Category 6: Issue-Specific Groups

### Denver Transit / Transportation Advocacy
- **Estimated size:** 1,000-10,000 members
- **Tier:** 3 (professional/identity-based)
- **Primary policy alignment:** Transportation, pedestrian infrastructure (43% of sidewalks missing/deficient), autonomous vehicles, climate/environment
- **Entry strategy:** Transit advocacy groups are already data-friendly and policy-literate. You can be more directly wonky here. The sidewalk data (43% missing/deficient, January 2026 State of System Report) and the pedestrian infrastructure data explorer are genuinely novel contributions that transit advocates will appreciate. Share the data, not the organization.
- **Tool to share:** Sidewalk data explorer (primary — this is a unique dataset), rent calculator (transit access and housing cost intersection)
- **Lurk period notes:** Track RTD complaints (service cuts, reliability), bike infrastructure discussions, and Vision Zero threads. These are all in-scope.

**Search terms:** `Denver transit`, `Denver bike`, `Denver transportation`, `RTD Denver`, `Denver pedestrians`, `Denver walkability`

### Denver Environmental / Climate Groups
- **Estimated size:** 1,000-5,000 members
- **Tier:** 3 (professional/identity-based)
- **Primary policy alignment:** Climate/environment, water security, waste/circular economy, municipal broadband (digital infrastructure as green infrastructure), transportation
- **Entry strategy:** Environmental groups care about the 80x50 Climate Plan, the Climate Protection Fund ($40M/year), Suncor pollution, and environmental justice. The climate policy's connection to housing (energy-efficient social housing), transportation (transit investment), and infrastructure (broadband reducing car trips) offers multiple entry points.
- **Tool to share:** Sidewalk data explorer (pedestrian infrastructure as climate infrastructure)
- **Lurk period notes:** Watch for Suncor/pollution threads (GES communities), Xcel rate discussions (energy affordability, SB26-002), and composting/waste discussions.

**Search terms:** `Denver environment`, `Denver climate`, `Denver sustainability`, `Denver clean air`, `Colorado environment Denver`

### Denver Disability / Accessibility Advocacy
- **Estimated size:** 500-3,000 members
- **Tier:** 3 (professional/identity-based)
- **Primary policy alignment:** Disability rights & inclusion, pedestrian infrastructure (ADA compliance), aging & accessibility, public safety (police interactions with disabled people), healthcare, transportation
- **Entry strategy:** The disability policy and the sidewalk data are directly relevant. The public safety policy's section on police violence against disabled people (1/3 to 1/2 of all people killed by police, Ruderman Foundation 2016) and the STAR program's disability-competent response proposal are powerful and underrepresented in policy discussions. Share data, not pity.
- **Tool to share:** Sidewalk data explorer (ADA compliance data is critical for this community)
- **Lurk period notes:** Watch for sidewalk/curb cut complaints, transit accessibility issues, police encounter stories, and healthcare access barriers. These are all policy entry points.

**Search terms:** `Denver disability`, `Denver accessibility`, `Denver disabled community`, `Denver ADA`

## Prioritized Join Order: First 5 Groups

Based on the intersection of group activity, policy alignment, and where Denver For All's data adds the most unique value:

### 1. Denver Renters / Denver Tenant Group (Tier 1)
**Why first:** Highest policy alignment of any group. Every housing policy speaks directly to this audience. The eviction tracker and know-your-rights chatbot are immediately useful tools that no one else in the comments section can offer. People here are actively dealing with the problems Denver For All's policies address. Every interaction is a potential organizing conversion.

### 2. Denver Community Forum / Denver Colorado Community (Tier 1)
**Why second:** Largest audience reach. General groups surface the broadest range of policy-relevant discussions — rent, broadband, crime, infrastructure, wages. You'll encounter threads relevant to 30+ of the 49 policies. The audience is more politically diverse than issue-specific groups, which means your data-driven approach reaches people who aren't already convinced.

### 3. Denver Parents / Denver Moms (Tier 1)
**Why third:** Universal childcare is one of the most emotionally resonant policies with the broadest demographic appeal. The $2,200/month childcare cost, the $7-13 return per $1 invested (Heckman), and the Quebec model (paid for itself) are jaw-dropping data points that perform well in parent groups. Parents share content in group chats — this is the one-pager distribution channel.

### 4. Capitol Hill Neighborhood Group (Tier 2)
**Why fourth:** Highest renter density in Denver, politically engaged demographic, and directly relevant to rent stabilization, tenant rights, pedestrian infrastructure, and STAR program data. Cap Hill groups tend to be large and active with high engagement. This is also a testing ground — content that works in Capitol Hill can be adapted for other neighborhood groups.

### 5. Montbello / Green Valley Ranch / Far Northeast Denver (Tier 2)
**Why fifth:** Underserved neighborhoods where Denver For All's data adds the most unique value. These communities are typically ignored by advocacy organizations that focus on central Denver. Showing up with data about their specific healthcare gaps, broadband redlining, and infrastructure deficits demonstrates that the platform serves the whole city — not just the neighborhoods that already get attention. Also critical for credibility with community organizations like Focus Points and for Spanish-language outreach development.

## Notes for Whoever Executes This

1. **Join no more than 2-3 groups per week.** Joining 15 groups at once looks like astroturfing and may trigger Facebook's spam detection.
2. **Track which groups you've joined and your status** (lurking / first comments / established) in a spreadsheet.
3. **Every group has different norms.** Some allow resource sharing, some have strict no-politics rules, some are mostly memes. Adapt.
4. **Do not post identical content across groups.** Customize for each group's concerns and tone.
5. **The tools are your secret weapon.** Nobody else in a Denver Facebook group comment section can link to an interactive eviction tracker, a bilingual tenant rights chatbot, or a sidewalk data explorer. Lead with tools that help people, not policy documents they won't read.
