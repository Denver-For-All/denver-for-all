## The Problem

Denver police have killed residents, brutalized protesters (2020 George Floyd protests), and operated with minimal accountability. The current oversight structure lacks independence, subpoena power, or the ability to impose discipline. Officers who commit misconduct are rarely held accountable, and qualified immunity shields them from civil liability.

Meanwhile, police are dispatched to situations they're not trained for - mental health crises, homelessness, substance use - because the city has failed to invest in alternatives. The result: people in crisis encounter armed officers instead of mental health professionals.

Denver's police budget is approximately $300M/year (Denver Budget, 2024). The STAR program receives approximately $6M -- 2% of the police budget.

### What Denver Currently Does

Denver already has the Office of the Independent Monitor (OIM), created in 2004, which reviews police complaints and monitors investigations. However, the OIM cannot independently investigate, lacks subpoena power, cannot impose discipline, and serves in an advisory role. The Citizen Oversight Board exists but is appointed by the mayor -- not independently elected -- and also lacks enforcement authority. This structure has not prevented persistent misconduct: Denver paid $35.3M in law enforcement settlements from 2017-2023, with $17.3M in 2023 alone (Denver City Attorney records; Denver Post analysis, 2024).

The STAR program launched in 2020 and has handled 10,000+ calls with zero incidents requiring police backup (STAR Program Annual Report, 2023). It currently operates limited hours in limited areas. This is the most successful public safety innovation Denver has made in decades, and it is chronically underfunded.

### Who Opposes This (and Why)

The Denver Police Protective Association (DPPA) is the primary opponent. Police unions consistently oppose oversight with teeth, budget reductions, and qualified immunity reform. The DPPA donates to city council candidates and mayoral campaigns. The Downtown Denver Partnership and some business improvement districts will raise concerns about perceived safety impacts. Counter: the evidence from every city that has invested in non-police crisis response shows equal or better outcomes. STAR's own track record proves this.

## Our Solution

### 1. Independent Civilian Oversight Board
- Elected board (not mayoral appointees) with full subpoena power
- Authority to investigate complaints, access all records, and impose discipline
- Budget independent from police department
- Public hearings on use-of-force incidents
- Annual audit of police practices published publicly

### 2. STAR Program Expansion (Non-Police Crisis Response)
- 24/7 citywide coverage for mental health, substance use, and homelessness calls
- Mental health professionals + paramedics - no police
- Target: 40% of current 911 calls rerouted to non-police responders
- 911 dispatchers retrained to triage calls appropriately
- (See: Healthcare proposal for full STAR details)

### 3. Budget Reallocation: 25% Redirect
Over 4 years, redirect 25% of police budget ($75M/year) to:
- STAR program expansion ($20M)
- Community violence intervention programs ($15M)
- Youth services and after-school programs ($15M)
- Substance use treatment and recovery ($10M)
- Restorative justice programs ($10M)
- Affordable housing (contributes to root cause reduction) ($5M)

### 4. End Qualified Immunity (City Level)
- Denver waives qualified immunity defense for all city employees, including police officers
- Officers can be held personally liable in civil suits for constitutional violations
- City provides legal defense only when officer followed policy and training
- Officers carry personal liability insurance (similar to doctors' malpractice insurance)

### 5. Use of Force Reforms
- Ban chokeholds and carotid restraints - permanently
- Duty to intervene: officers must stop other officers' excessive force or face equal discipline
- Duty to report: failure to report excessive force is a firing offense
- De-escalation required before any use of force
- Body cameras mandatory and always on during encounters - footage publicly accessible within 72 hours of any use-of-force incident

### 6. Community Violence Intervention
- Fund evidence-based violence intervention programs (Cure Violence model)
- Credible messengers from affected communities, not police
- Targeted intervention in highest-violence neighborhoods
- Hospital-based intervention for gunshot victims (prevent retaliation cycles)

### 7. End Mass Surveillance Without Democratic Oversight

Denver's police department operates 111 Flock Safety automatic license plate reader (ALPR) cameras across nearly 70 intersections, photographing over 2 million vehicles per month. This mass surveillance infrastructure was deployed without a council vote, and when democratic accountability was finally exercised, it was overridden.

**What happened with Flock:**

- **May 2025:** Denver City Council voted **12-0** to reject a $666,000 two-year Flock contract extension, responding to massive community opposition.
- **August 2025:** Mayor Johnston bypassed the council by signing a **$498,509 contract** -- structured deliberately to fall just under the $500,000 threshold that would require council approval. This was not an accident. It was a calculated end-run around democratic oversight.
- **October 2025:** The mayor extended the contract again through March 2026, this time at no cost to the city -- another mechanism to avoid council review. Close to 700 people packed a town hall to protest. The majority of council members sent a letter to the city auditor asking him not to sign the agreement.
- **ICE data sharing:** Audit logs obtained through Colorado Open Records Act requests -- which DPD and the mayor's office delayed releasing for over three months -- revealed that Denver's Flock camera data had been searched **more than 1,400 times by ICE** since June 2024. This happened despite repeated assurances from the Johnston administration that no data was shared with immigration enforcement. Nationally, Flock's systems have been used by U.S. Border Patrol across over 82,000 cameras, and in one documented case a Texas sheriff's department used Flock to search across 83,000 cameras to locate a woman who had an abortion.
- **Councilwoman Flor Alvidrez** stated publicly: "I'm tired of seeing major public safety decisions made behind council's back."
- **At-large Councilmember Sarah Parady** called Flock "dishonest" and said she was "stunned" by the negotiations conducted without council involvement.

The Flock situation demonstrates exactly why Denver needs a surveillance technology oversight ordinance. When the mayor can deploy mass tracking systems without a vote, structure contracts to dodge review thresholds, and withhold audit logs showing federal immigration access to local data, the city's oversight structure has failed. (See: [Government Transparency & Digital Rights](/platform/government-transparency) for our full surveillance oversight proposal.)

Our demands:
- **Immediately deactivate** all Flock cameras until a full council vote authorizes their use with binding privacy safeguards
- **City council approval required** before any surveillance technology is acquired or deployed -- no exceptions, no threshold manipulation
- **No ICE access** to any Denver surveillance data, with automatic contract termination and criminal referral for violations
- **ALPR data retention limited to 30 days** -- not indefinite mass tracking of Denver residents' movements
- **Public audit logs** for all surveillance data access, published monthly, with no three-month delays
- **Annual public hearings** on all active surveillance systems with community testimony

### International Evidence: Punishment Doesn't Work. Investment Does.

| Country | Model | Incarceration Rate | Recidivism | Result |
|---------|-------|-------------------|------------|--------|
| **Norway** | Rehabilitation-focused. Prisons resemble college campuses. Focus on reintegration: job training, education, therapy. Maximum sentence: 21 years. | 54 per 100K | **20%** | One of the lowest crime rates in the world. Prisoners come out as functioning citizens, not hardened criminals. |
| **Finland** | Open prisons where inmates work, attend school, go home on weekends. Focus on normality and skill-building. | 51 per 100K | **36%** | Crime has been declining for decades. Society saves money because fewer people return to prison. |
| **Germany** | Prisons run like vocational schools. Inmates learn trades, earn certifications, maintain family relationships. | 69 per 100K | **35-40%** | The goal is explicitly rehabilitation, not punishment. And it works - for public safety, not just for inmates. |
| **Netherlands** | Closing prisons due to falling crime rates. Focus on electronic monitoring, community service, and rehabilitation. | 59 per 100K | **45%** | So few prisoners that they've actually shut down prisons and rented empty cells to Belgium and Norway. |
| **USA** | Punishment-focused. Overcrowded, violent, minimal rehabilitation. Private prison industry profits from incarceration. | **531 per 100K** (highest in the world) | **76%** | We lock up 10x more people than Norway, spend vastly more, and get vastly worse outcomes. Three-quarters of released prisoners return. The system does not produce safety - it produces repeat offenders. |

**The US incarceration rate is the highest on Earth** - higher than Russia, China, or any authoritarian regime. And our recidivism rate proves it doesn't work. Norway rehabilitates 80% of its prisoners. We rehabilitate 24%.

Denver can't reform the state prison system alone, but Denver CAN:
- Redirect police budget to prevention and intervention
- Implement restorative justice that reduces incarceration
- End the police-to-prison pipeline for mental health crises and substance use
- Model what evidence-based public safety looks like

## How We Pay For It

This is primarily a budget reallocation, not new spending. Moving $75M from police to services that address root causes costs the city $0 net.

Civilian oversight board: $3-5M/year from general fund.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Won't reducing police funding increase crime?"**
Studies show no correlation between police spending and crime rates. What does reduce crime: housing stability, employment, mental health treatment, youth services, and community investment. We're investing in what works.

**"Who responds to violent crime?"**
Police. This plan doesn't eliminate police - it refocuses them on violent crime and removes responsibilities they're not trained for. A smaller, better-trained, better-supervised police force focused on actual public safety threats.

**"Isn't ending qualified immunity too extreme?"**
Doctors carry malpractice insurance. Lawyers can be disbarred. Every profession except policing faces personal accountability for professional misconduct. This is not extreme - it's the baseline that every other profession already meets.

**"What about Denver's current crime trends?"**
Denver's crime data is mixed. Violent crime peaked in 2022 and has been declining. Property crime remains elevated. Neither trend correlates with police budget levels -- Denver's police budget has increased consistently while crime rates have fluctuated independently. What does correlate with crime: housing instability, poverty, substance use, and lack of mental health services. That is exactly where we propose redirecting resources.

**"Don't Flock cameras reduce crime and recover stolen vehicles?"**
Denver attributed 352 arrests and 250 recovered vehicles to Flock cameras, but auto thefts dropped from 12,000 to 8,550 during a period when auto thefts declined nationally regardless of camera presence. Independent research finds no consistent evidence that ALPR camera networks reduce crime (Forbes, 2024). What Flock cameras verifiably do: photograph 2 million vehicles per month, create a mass tracking database of Denver residents' movements, and share that data with ICE over 1,400 times without public knowledge. The question is whether the marginal enforcement benefit justifies a surveillance system the city council unanimously rejected, the mayor imposed unilaterally, and ICE exploited for immigration enforcement in a sanctuary city.

**"Didn't Mayor Johnston add safeguards to the new Flock contract?"**
The October 2025 contract includes a $100,000 damages clause for Flock data breaches and memoranda of understanding restricting federal immigration access. But a legal expert flagged that the damages clause only applies when Flock is responsible for the breach -- not when another agency misuses the data. More fundamentally: these safeguards were negotiated by the mayor's office behind closed doors, without council involvement, after the council voted 12-0 against the contract. The safeguards themselves are a concession that the surveillance was problematic from the start. The democratic failure is the process, not just the product.

**"Doesn't Denver already have civilian oversight?"**
Denver has the Office of the Independent Monitor (OIM, est. 2004) and a Citizen Oversight Board. Neither can independently investigate, subpoena records, or impose discipline. They are advisory bodies that review police self-investigations. This is not oversight -- it is observation. Our proposal creates an elected board with actual enforcement power.
