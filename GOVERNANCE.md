# Governance

This document describes how Denver For All is organized, how decisions are made, and how the project operates.

## Project Structure

Denver For All is a grassroots, open-source civic platform governed by its maintainers with input from the community. The project is currently self-hosted on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/denver-for-all) without a fiscal host. An initial application to [Open Source Collective](https://opencollective.com/opensource) was rejected due to an apparent mismatch with auto-filled fields; we are appealing the decision and may apply to an alternative fiscal host on Open Collective.

### Roles

**Maintainers** are responsible for the overall direction of the project, reviewing contributions, managing releases, and representing the project publicly. Maintainers have write access to the repository and admin access to the Open Collective page.

**Contributors** are anyone who participates in the project — by submitting code, policy research, translations, bug reports, design work, or other contributions. Contributors do not need any special access to participate.

**Community members** are Denver residents, organizers, and advocates who use the platform, provide feedback, attend events, or engage with the project's mission without directly contributing to the codebase or content.

### Current Maintainers

| Name | Role | GitHub |
|------|------|--------|
| Dan McHale | Project Lead | @dmchaledev |
| Boden McHale | Owner | @BodenMcHale |

We welcome additional maintainers. If you are a regular contributor and want to take on a maintainer role, please reach out.

## Decision-Making

### Day-to-Day Decisions

Routine decisions (bug fixes, minor content updates, dependency upgrades, documentation improvements) are made by any maintainer and do not require group consensus.

### Significant Decisions

Decisions that affect the project's direction, scope, or community require discussion before action. These include:

- Adding or removing policy positions
- Changing the project's technology stack
- Modifying the governance structure
- Spending decisions over $100 from the Open Collective fund
- Partnerships or endorsements
- Changes to the Code of Conduct

For these decisions:

1. A maintainer or contributor opens a GitHub issue or discussion describing the proposal
2. The community has at least 7 days to comment and discuss
3. Maintainers make the final decision, incorporating community feedback
4. The decision and reasoning are documented in the issue

### Conflict Resolution

If maintainers disagree on a significant decision:

1. Discussion continues until consensus is reached
2. If consensus cannot be reached, the Project Lead makes the final call
3. The dissenting position is documented alongside the decision

## Financial Transparency

All funds are managed through [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/denver-for-all) with full public transparency:

- Every incoming donation is visible on the public ledger
- Every expense is submitted with a receipt and approved by a maintainer
- Anyone can view the complete financial history at any time
- Spending decisions over $100 are discussed publicly before submission

## Succession Planning

If the Project Lead becomes unable or unwilling to continue:

1. Existing maintainers collectively assume stewardship
2. If no other maintainers exist, the fiscal host (once established) will facilitate a transition
3. The project's open-source license ensures the code and content remain freely available regardless of leadership changes

The project should always have at least two people with admin access to:
- The GitHub organization
- The Open Collective page
- The Cloudflare account
- The domain registrar

## Becoming a Maintainer

Contributors who demonstrate sustained, quality participation may be invited to become maintainers. Indicators include:

- Regular, constructive contributions over a period of months
- Understanding of the project's mission and technical architecture
- Good judgment in community interactions
- Willingness to review others' contributions

Any current maintainer can nominate a contributor. The decision requires agreement from all existing maintainers.

## Amendments

This governance document can be amended through the significant decision process described above. Changes require at least 14 days of community discussion before adoption.
