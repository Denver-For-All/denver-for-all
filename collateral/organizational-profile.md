## Mission Statement

Denver For All is a grassroots political organization building power for working people in Denver. We are tenants, workers, parents, organizers, and neighbors who believe that Denver should work for every one of its residents — especially those being squeezed by rising costs.

## Core Beliefs

1. Housing is a human right, not a commodity
2. Every worker deserves a living wage — no exceptions, no tipped minimums
3. Healthcare should not bankrupt you
4. People experiencing addiction need treatment, not prison
5. Immigrants are our neighbors and deserve protection, not persecution
6. Public money should serve the public — not corporations
7. Democracy means more than voting every four years — it means power in the hands of the people

## What We Do

- **Policy Research:** 47 data-driven, evidence-based policy proposals covering housing, labor, healthcare, public safety, immigration, infrastructure, education, democracy, climate, and economic justice
- **Civic Tools:** 8 free interactive tools that hold power accountable and empower residents
- **Grassroots Organizing:** Outreach infrastructure across social media, community groups, Spanish-language communities, and direct action channels
- **Candidate Accountability:** Standardized surveys for all 2027 council and mayoral candidates; unedited responses published
- **Legislative Analysis:** Tier-classified implementation pathways for all 47 proposals, with a 6-month filing sequence for the 10 proposals that can be introduced immediately

6. **Council Candidate Tracker** — Standardized 10-question survey for all 2027 council candidates
