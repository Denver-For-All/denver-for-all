Translate the following content from English to **Amharic (አማርኛ)**.

Language-specific guidelines:
- Use **formal written Amharic** appropriate for civic/government communication
- Use standard Ge'ez (Ethiopic) script — ፊደል
- For civic/legal terms, use standard Amharic administrative terminology where it exists (e.g., "policy" → "ፖሊሲ", "legislation" → "ሕግ", "government" → "መንግሥት")
- "Denver For All" → keep as "Denver For All" (do not translate the project name)
- For section headings like "The Problem" / "Our Solution" / "How We Pay For It", use: "ችግሩ" / "የእኛ መፍትሔ" / "እንዴት እንከፍላለን"
- For U.S.-specific terms, use translations commonly used by Amharic-speaking media in the US (e.g., "City Council" → "የከተማ ምክር ቤት", "Mayor" → "ከንቲባ")
- For technical/policy terms that have no standard Amharic equivalent, transliterate the English term in Ge'ez script and provide a brief Amharic explanation in parentheses on first use. Example: "Housing First (ቤት በቅድሚያ — መጀመሪያ ቤት መስጠት)"
- Keep monetary amounts in USD format ($XX,XXX)
- Numbers should remain in Western Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3), not Ge'ez numerals
- Amharic uses its own punctuation: use ። (full stop), ፣ (comma), ፤ (semicolon), ፧ (question mark) where appropriate within Amharic text, but keep markdown syntax markers (*, -, #, etc.) as-is

**IMPORTANT — Quality note:** Amharic is a lower-resource language for AI translation. After generating these translations, they MUST be reviewed by a native Amharic speaker before publishing. Flag any terms where you are uncertain with [REVIEW: explanation] inline.
