## Project Narrative

### A. Project Description

**Project Title:** Denver Vision Zero Implementation — High Injury Network Intersection Redesign, Protected Bike Lanes, and Automated Speed Enforcement

**Applicant:** City and County of Denver, Department of Transportation & Infrastructure (DOTI)

**Requested Amount:** $18,000,000

**Project Duration:** 36 months

**Project Summary:** The City and County of Denver requests $18 million in combined Highway Safety Improvement Program and Safe Streets for All Implementation Grant funding to redesign the city's 20 deadliest intersections, build protected bike lanes on high-crash corridors, deploy automated speed enforcement in school zones, and upgrade pedestrian signals across Denver's High Injury Network. Denver adopted Vision Zero in 2017 with a goal of zero traffic deaths by 2030. Fatalities have increased every year since adoption. In 2025, 93 people died on Denver streets — the deadliest year since 2013 — including 35 pedestrians, a 34% increase over 2024. Pedestrians represent approximately 5% of Denver commuters but 33% of traffic fatalities, making them roughly 30 times more likely to die than vehicle occupants. The High Injury Network has been identified but redesign has been slow, automated enforcement remains limited, and the city's 254 miles of bike lanes contain critical gaps on the corridors where crashes are concentrated. This project targets the specific intersections, corridors, and neighborhoods where people are dying and delivers proven, evidence-based safety treatments at the scale required to reverse Denver's worsening fatality trend.

### B. Location & Context

**Project Area:** City and County of Denver, Colorado (population ~715,000)

**Priority Corridors and Intersections (ranked by crash frequency, fatality rate, and equity indicators):**

- I-70/Peoria interchange and surrounding arterials (103 crashes in 2024)
- Federal Boulevard (full corridor)
- Colfax Avenue (East and West segments)
- Alameda Avenue
- Broadway / Lincoln corridor
- Colorado Boulevard
- Havana Street
- Smith Road / Central Park Boulevard
- 56th Avenue / Pena Boulevard approaches
- Montbello / Green Valley Ranch arterial network

**Urbanized Area:** Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area

**Underserved Communities:** Montbello, Green Valley Ranch, Far Northeast, and Westwood are the most transportation-underserved neighborhoods in Denver. These communities face car-dependent street design with inadequate transit service, the highest pedestrian crash rates, and the fewest safe cycling facilities. When RTD built the A Line to the airport, it routed around Montbello and cut bus routes from seven to three, simultaneously creating a transit desert and a food desert. Multiple target intersections and corridors fall within Census tracts that qualify as disadvantaged communities under the Justice40 initiative.

### C. Safety Problem Identification

Denver's traffic safety data documents a crisis that is worsening, not improving, despite a formal Vision Zero commitment now entering its eighth year:

**Fatal and Serious Injury Data:**

- 93 traffic deaths in 2025, the deadliest year since 2013 (Denver Vision Zero Dashboard, 2025)
- 35 pedestrian fatalities in 2025, a 34% increase over 2024
- Pedestrians represent ~5% of commuters but ~33% of traffic deaths
- Pedestrians are approximately 30x more likely to die than vehicle occupants per trip
- The I-70/Peoria interchange recorded 103 crashes in a single year (2024)
- Low-income neighborhoods experience disproportionately higher fatality rates

**High Injury Network and Infrastructure Deficiency:**

- Denver has identified its High Injury Network — the subset of streets where fatal and serious injury crashes are concentrated — but has been slow to redesign these corridors
- Automated speed enforcement remains limited despite proven effectiveness in reducing speeds and fatalities without racial profiling
- 254 miles of bike lanes exist, but critical gaps persist on high-crash corridors, particularly in east Denver, Capitol Hill, Montbello, and Far Northeast
- Denver's Vision Zero Action Plan (adopted 2017, updated 2022) has not been matched with capital investment at the scale required to reduce fatalities
- Over 81% of Denver commuters drive alone; drivers lost an average of 76 hours to congestion in 2024 (Texas A&M Transportation Institute, 2025)

**Existing Safety Plans:**

- Denver Vision Zero Action Plan (2017, updated 2022)
- Denver High Injury Network analysis
- Denver Moves: Bikes plan (targeting 230+ new miles of bikeways)
- DOTI Sidewalk Implementation Plan (2025)

Denver's trajectory is moving decisively away from its Vision Zero goal. Annual traffic deaths have risen from 51 at the time of Vision Zero adoption to 93 in 2025 — an 82% increase. Without a major acceleration of proven safety interventions on the corridors where people are dying, Denver will not approach zero deaths by 2030 or any foreseeable date.

### D. Project Activities & Deliverables

**Activity 1: Top 20 Intersection Redesigns ($8,000,000)**

- Redesign the 20 highest-crash intersections on Denver's High Injury Network using proven safety treatments
- Treatments to include: curb extensions (bulb-outs) to shorten pedestrian crossing distances, protected intersection geometry for bicycle movements, raised crosswalks to reduce vehicle turning speeds, restricted turn movements where conflict analysis warrants, improved sight lines through daylighting and parking setback adjustments, and high-visibility crosswalk markings
- Priority intersections include the I-70/Peoria interchange approaches and the highest-crash nodes on Federal Boulevard, Colfax Avenue, Colorado Boulevard, Havana Street, and Alameda Avenue
- Each intersection redesign to include a Road Safety Audit (RSA) in the design phase and a post-construction safety evaluation at 12 and 24 months
- Engineering design to follow FHWA Proven Safety Countermeasures and NACTO intersection design guidance
- Community engagement at each intersection site, with a minimum of two public meetings per project cluster, conducted in English and Spanish

**Activity 2: Protected Bike Lane Buildout on High-Crash Corridors ($5,000,000)**

- Construct approximately 15-20 miles of physically protected bike lanes on corridors identified by both the High Injury Network and the Denver Moves: Bikes plan gap analysis
- Protection to consist of physical separation (concrete curbs, raised lanes, flexible delineator posts with concrete bases, or planter-based barriers), not paint-only markings
- Priority corridors: segments connecting underserved neighborhoods (Montbello, Green Valley Ranch, Far Northeast, Westwood) to rail stations, bus hubs, schools, and employment centers
- Include protected intersection treatments at major cross-streets to eliminate the highest-risk conflict points for cyclists
- Install bike signal phases at signalized intersections along protected corridors
- Coordinate with Denver Moves: Bikes plan to maximize network connectivity and advance the city's goal of placing a high-comfort bikeway within a quarter-mile of every household
- All designs to meet or exceed NACTO Urban Bikeway Design Guide standards

**Activity 3: Automated Speed Enforcement in School Zones ($2,000,000)**

- Deploy automated speed enforcement cameras in 30-40 school zones, prioritized by pedestrian crash history and proximity to High Injury Network corridors
- Prioritize schools in Montbello, Green Valley Ranch, Far Northeast, Westwood, Elyria-Swansea, and Globeville — neighborhoods with the highest child pedestrian injury rates
- Include a 30-day warning period at each new installation before citations are issued
- Revenue from citations to be dedicated to a Safe Routes to School fund for additional safety improvements
- Ensure equitable implementation: no vehicle impoundment or license suspension for unpaid fines; sliding-scale fine structure based on income where permitted by state law
- Install supporting infrastructure at each location: school zone gateway signage, flashing beacons, and high-visibility crosswalk markings
- Evaluate speed reduction and crash outcomes at 6, 12, and 24 months post-installation

**Activity 4: Pedestrian Signal Improvements on High Injury Network ($2,000,000)**

- Upgrade pedestrian signal infrastructure at approximately 80-100 intersections on the High Injury Network
- Treatments to include: Leading Pedestrian Intervals (LPIs) giving pedestrians a 7-10 second head start before vehicles receive a green signal, extended pedestrian crossing times calibrated to a 3.0 ft/s walking speed (accommodating elderly and mobility-impaired pedestrians), accessible pedestrian signals (APS) with audible and tactile indicators, and countdown timers at all upgraded locations
- Install pedestrian-scale lighting at the 25 highest-crash pedestrian locations, particularly mid-block crossing areas and transit stops
- Add Rectangular Rapid Flashing Beacons (RRFBs) at 15-20 uncontrolled marked crosswalks on arterial roads within the High Injury Network
- Prioritize intersections within a quarter-mile of schools, transit stops, senior housing, and healthcare facilities

**Activity 5: Project Management, Community Engagement, and Evaluation ($1,000,000)**

- Dedicated project manager (full-time) and grant compliance coordinator (full-time) for 36 months
- Data analyst (full-time) to manage crash data collection, before/after analysis, and performance reporting
- Community engagement program: minimum 3 public meetings per target neighborhood (conducted in English and Spanish), project website with interactive maps, and partnerships with neighborhood organizations in Montbello, Green Valley Ranch, Far Northeast, and Westwood
- Pre-construction baseline data collection: crash frequency and severity, vehicle speeds (85th percentile), pedestrian and bicycle counts, and community perception surveys
- Post-construction evaluation at 12, 24, and 36 months using the same metrics
- Final evaluation report documenting methodology, outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and replicability for other Denver corridors and peer cities
- Quarterly progress reports to FHWA/USDOT as required by grant terms

### F. Alignment with HSIP and SS4A Program Goals

This project advances both the Highway Safety Improvement Program and Safe Streets for All program objectives:

**HSIP Alignment:**

1. **Addresses identified safety problems on public roads:** All project activities target locations documented in Denver's High Injury Network analysis and crash data, meeting HSIP's requirement for data-driven safety investment
2. **Applies FHWA Proven Safety Countermeasures:** Intersection redesigns, Leading Pedestrian Intervals, Rectangular Rapid Flashing Beacons, and automated speed enforcement are all FHWA-designated Proven Safety Countermeasures with documented crash reduction factors
3. **Consistent with Colorado's Strategic Highway Safety Plan (SHSP):** Project activities align with CDOT emphasis areas including pedestrian safety, intersection safety, speed management, and bicycle safety
4. **Quantifiable safety outcomes:** Each activity includes pre/post evaluation methodology enabling calculation of crash modification factors for Colorado's HSIP reporting

**SS4A Alignment:**

1. **Carries out a comprehensive safety action plan:** Implements specific, high-priority elements of Denver's Vision Zero Action Plan on the corridors where fatalities are concentrated
2. **Addresses identified safety needs through infrastructure investment:** Targets the intersections, corridors, and school zones with the highest documented crash rates
3. **Incorporates equity:** Prioritizes Montbello, Green Valley Ranch, Far Northeast, and Westwood — the city's most transportation-underserved neighborhoods, which are disproportionately low-income communities of color bearing the greatest burden of traffic violence
4. **Integrates Safe System approach:** Addresses multiple Safe System elements: safe roads (intersection redesign, protected bike lanes), safe speeds (automated enforcement, signal timing), safe road users (community engagement, school zone protections), and post-crash care (reduced crash severity through speed reduction and conflict elimination)
5. **Demonstrates sustainability:** Automated enforcement generates ongoing revenue for maintenance; intersection redesigns are permanent infrastructure; protected bike lanes encourage mode shift reducing long-term crash exposure

## Budget Summary

| Category                                              | Amount          | % of Total |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| Intersection Redesigns (top 20 High Injury Network)   | $8,000,000      | 44%        |
| Protected Bike Lane Buildout (high-crash corridors)   | $5,000,000      | 28%        |
| Automated Speed Enforcement (school zones)            | $2,000,000      | 11%        |
| Pedestrian Signal Improvements (High Injury Network)  | $2,000,000      | 11%        |
| Project Management, Engagement & Evaluation           | $1,000,000      | 6%         |
| **Total Federal Request**                             | **$18,000,000** | **100%**   |
| Local Match (DOTI capital budget + Vision Zero funds) | $5,400,000      | —          |
| **Total Project Investment**                          | **$23,400,000** | —          |

**Note on Federal/Local Split:** HSIP funds are available at a 90/10 federal/local match for safety projects on Federal-aid highways. SS4A Implementation Grants require a minimum 20% local match. The budget above assumes a blended 77/23 federal/local ratio. Denver's local match will be funded through existing DOTI capital budget allocations for Vision Zero and bike infrastructure, demonstrating that the city is supplementing — not replacing — local safety investment with federal funds. The city's annual Vision Zero and bike infrastructure spending of $5-10 million per year (DOTI capital budget) and the $13.4 million invested in bike lanes between 2018 and 2023 demonstrate sustained local commitment.

## Expected Outcomes

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Annual traffic fatalities (citywide)                                   | 93 (2025)                                 | 20-30% reduction (65-74)                   |
| Annual pedestrian fatalities (citywide)                                | 35 (2025)                                 | 30-40% reduction (21-25)                   |
| Crashes at redesigned intersections                                    | Varies by site (avg. ~25/year)            | 40% reduction per intersection             |
| 85th percentile speed in school zones with automated enforcement       | Estimated 30-35 mph                       | Reduced to 20-25 mph                       |
| Miles of protected bike lanes                                          | 254 miles total (limited protection)      | +15-20 miles of physically protected lanes |
| Cyclist fatalities and serious injuries on project corridors           | ~8-12 serious injuries/year               | 30% reduction                              |
| Intersections with Leading Pedestrian Intervals on High Injury Network | Limited deployment                        | 80-100 intersections upgraded              |
| Pedestrian signal compliance with APS standards                        | ~35% of High Injury Network intersections | ~75% of High Injury Network intersections  |

**Crash Reduction Methodology:** Expected outcomes are based on published Crash Modification Factors (CMFs) from the FHWA CMF Clearinghouse. Intersection redesigns combining curb extensions, raised crosswalks, and restricted turn movements have documented CMFs of 0.47-0.70 for pedestrian crashes. Leading Pedestrian Intervals reduce pedestrian-vehicle crashes by an estimated 13% (CMF = 0.87). Automated speed enforcement in school zones reduces injury crashes by 20-40% in peer city deployments (IIHS, 2024). Protected bike lanes reduce cyclist injury risk by 75% compared to unprotected lanes (Teschke et al., 2012).

## How to Use This Template

This grant proposal template is designed for city staff, council members, and community advocates to adapt for actual HSIP and SS4A applications:

1. **Determine the appropriate funding stream.** HSIP funds flow through CDOT and are available on a rolling basis for safety projects on Federal-aid highways; coordinate with CDOT Region 1 for Denver-area applications. SS4A Implementation Grants are competitive and require an existing safety action plan; check [grants.gov](https://www.grants.gov/) and the [SS4A NOFO](https://www.transportation.gov/grants/ss4a) for current cycle deadlines and requirements. A combined or sequenced application strategy may be appropriate — HSIP for intersection and signal work on state routes, SS4A for bike lanes, school zone enforcement, and local street improvements.
2. **Refine intersection and corridor data** using the latest Vision Zero Dashboard, DOTI crash reports, and High Injury Network maps. Update crash counts, fatality figures, and 85th percentile speed data with the most recent available year.
3. **Adjust the budget** based on current construction cost estimates from DOTI procurement. Intersection redesign costs vary significantly by scope; confirm unit costs for curb extensions, raised crosswalks, signal equipment, and protected bike lane construction with DOTI engineering staff.
4. **Update local match figures** to reflect current DOTI capital budget allocations for Vision Zero, bike infrastructure, and traffic safety.
5. **Add required federal forms** including SF-424, SF-424A (budget), budget narrative/justification, NEPA documentation (Categorical Exclusion expected for most activities), equity analysis, and letters of support from community organizations, Denver Public Schools, and CDOT.
6. **Secure letters of support** from neighborhood organizations in Montbello, Green Valley Ranch, Far Northeast, and Westwood; Denver Streets Partnership; Denver Public Schools (for school zone enforcement); and the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG).
7. **Coordinate with DOTI grant writing staff and CDOT Region 1** for submission timing and technical requirements.
