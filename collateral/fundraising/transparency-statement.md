## Transparency & Accountability

Denver For All is a grassroots, non-partisan research initiative dedicated to making Denver's public data accessible and actionable — from eviction patterns to sidewalk safety to campaign finance.

### How Funds Are Used

We are an unincorporated group of developers and researchers. **100% of your contributions go directly toward the hard costs of maintaining this platform.** Every dollar received and every dollar spent is visible on our public Open Collective ledger.

**What your donations fund:**

- **Research & Analysis Tools** — AI-powered policy research using Claude by Anthropic, producing evidence-based proposals grounded in academic literature, international case studies, and Denver-specific data
- **Data Infrastructure** — API access, data processing, and storage for our eviction tracker, campaign finance tracker, and sidewalk data explorer
- **Hosting & Platform** — Server costs to keep our 8 civic tools and 47 policy proposals online and accessible 24/7
- **Bilingual Access** — Spanish translations ensuring 30% of Denver's population can engage with our research and tools
- **Tenant Rights Chatbot** — Voice AI service powering our 24/7 English/Spanish tenant assistance line

**What your donations do NOT fund:**

- **No salaries.** All development, research, and advocacy work is performed on a volunteer basis.
- **No corporate partnerships.** We accept no corporate money and maintain no corporate relationships.
- **No political campaigns.** We do not support or oppose candidates. Our candidate trackers publish unedited responses to standardized questions — nonpartisan voter education, not endorsements.

### Public Ledger

We use [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/denver-for-all) to maintain a **public, real-time ledger** of every dollar received and spent. Anyone — donors, residents, council members, journalists — can visit our page and see exactly where every contribution goes.

This isn't a quarterly report or an annual filing. It's a live, transparent record updated with every transaction. If we spend $15 on a domain name or $45 on sidewalk data APIs, you'll see the receipt.

### Open Source

Our entire platform is open source:
- **Policy research:** All 47 proposals are public and free to use, adapt, or republish
- **Code:** Our tools and website source code are publicly available
- **Grant templates:** 6 federal grant templates are available for any council member, city staff, or advocate to use
- **Public domain:** Our policy content is explicitly public domain — other cities can fork and adapt our work

### Legal Status

Denver For All is a volunteer-run, unincorporated civic research project fiscally hosted by [Open Source Collective](https://www.oscollective.org/), a 501(c)(6) organization. Contributions are not tax-deductible but are fully transparent and publicly documented.

### Policy Research, Not Political Campaigning

Our work is **issue advocacy and civic education**:

- We publish evidence-based policy research and suggest solutions. This is protected civic activity.
- We share research with council members, the mayor's office, and state legislators. Under Denver Municipal Code (DRMC 2-301), volunteer civic engagement falls under the Volunteer Exception to lobbyist registration.
- We do not engage in express advocacy for or against ballot measures or candidates. If our research informs future ballot measures, that is a sign the research is working — not a compliance issue.
- We track campaign finance and publish candidate positions as nonpartisan voter education, not endorsements.
