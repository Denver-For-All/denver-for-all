# Deliverable 3: Highest-Impact Op-Ed

## Strategic Reasoning

**Which op-ed to write first and why:**

The playbook already has draft op-ed samples for broadband (Denver Post/Colorado Sun), medical debt (letter to the editor), and STAR program (letter to the editor). I'm choosing a topic none of those cover.

**Recommendation: Eviction protections — timed to HB26-1106**

**Why this topic, right now:**

1. **Active legislative hook:** HB26-1106 (Eviction Protections for Tenants) is currently assigned to the Judiciary Committee. Public pressure during committee hearings moves votes. The CO-BILLS-2026 analysis ranks it #3 in strategic priority.

2. **Volume of human suffering:** 15,000+ eviction filings in Denver County Court in 2025 — 72% above pre-pandemic levels. This isn't a niche issue; it's the most common legal proceeding affecting Denver renters.

3. **Data asymmetry that editorial boards notice:** The 90% vs. 10% attorney representation stat is the kind of number that makes an editorial board say "we need to run this." It's specific, sourced, shocking, and immediately comprehensible.

4. **Not already being covered well by other orgs:** Colorado Poverty Law Project and Colorado Legal Services do direct eviction defense work but don't do public op-ed campaigns. Housing advocacy orgs focus on rent control (state preemption) and shelter funding. The eviction court data gap — the sheer procedural unfairness of it — is undercovered.

5. **Tool connection:** The eviction tracker on denverforall.org is a unique data asset no other org has published. Mentioning it in the op-ed drives traffic to a tool that converts readers into engaged users.

6. **2027 election framing:** Eviction policy will be a defining issue in city council races. An op-ed now establishes the data frame that candidates will have to respond to.

**Topics I considered but passed on:**
- *Flock/surveillance:* Active story, but heavily covered by ACLU, Denverite, Colorado Newsline already. Denver For All adds tools (Follow the Money) but not unique reporting. Also, the surveillance op-ed plays better as a letter to the editor reacting to a specific Flock development, not a standalone op-ed.
- *Childcare costs:* Jaw-dropping data, but no single active bill to rally around (HB26-1004, SB26-019, SB26-020 are incremental, not structural). Better suited as a one-pager or Reddit post.
- *Vacancy tax (HB26-1036):* #1 strategic priority for the legislative agenda, but conceptually harder to explain in an op-ed (requires TABOR context, ballot measure mechanics). Better suited for a Colorado Sun guest commentary aimed at policy-literate readers, not a first op-ed.

**Target outlet: Denverite**

Why: Denverite is the most accessible Tier 1 outlet for first-time writers, is deeply focused on housing and neighborhood issues, runs community voices pieces, and has a readership that skews toward politically engaged Denver residents who care about housing. The Denver Post is harder to place and reaches a broader but less targeted audience. The Colorado Sun would be right for a policy-wonk piece but this op-ed is written for emotional resonance, not legislative strategy.

## The Op-Ed (780 words)

**Title:** Denver's Eviction Court Is a Machine Built for Landlords. HB26-1106 Could Change That.

When our landlord tried to push our rent from $3,100 to over $5,400, my family was in the middle of searching for more accessible housing for my son. The timing couldn't have been worse. They posted eviction notices on doors before rent was even late — not just ours, everyone's. Papers taped up in the hallways like warnings. When we pushed back on the increase, they tried to pressure us into paying months of penalty at the new rate. They only backed down when we became more trouble than we were worth.

We got out. A lot of our neighbors didn't have that option.

I started looking at the data after we left, and the scale of it floored me. Last year, Denver County Court processed over 15,000 eviction filings — roughly 40 families a day. That number is 72 percent above pre-pandemic levels. The eviction machine didn't slow down after COVID protections expired. It sped up.

Here's the detail that makes the whole system make sense: over 90 percent of landlords in Denver eviction court have an attorney. Fewer than 10 percent of tenants do. Picture a traffic court where every officer has a lawyer and every driver represents themselves, except the penalty isn't a fine — it's losing your home.

The filings concentrate in the same neighborhoods with the highest poverty rates and the least access to legal help. If you map eviction filings by ZIP code, you're looking at a map of inequality in Denver. There's a publicly accessible eviction tracker at denverforall.org/tools/evictions that maps filings by neighborhood. The data is from Denver County Court. It's not opinion — it's what's happening.

**What other cities figured out**

New York City implemented a right-to-counsel program for tenants facing eviction in 2017. The results: eviction filings dropped by more than 30 percent. Not because tenants always win — because when landlords know tenants have lawyers, they stop filing frivolous cases. The playing field levels out and the system starts functioning like an actual legal proceeding instead of an assembly line.

San Francisco passed a similar right-to-counsel law. Same result: significant drops in eviction completions and a dramatic reduction in the number of tenants who lose their homes simply because they didn't know they could fight.

These aren't radical experiments. This is what happens when you give people lawyers in a legal proceeding that determines whether they have a home. In most of Europe, tenant protections are built into housing law so deeply that the American eviction process would be unrecognizable. Germany requires landlords to demonstrate legally defined grounds for eviction and provides substantial notice periods. The UK requires a minimum six-month notice for no-fault evictions under recent reforms. Colorado requires 10 days.

**What's happening right now in the legislature**

HB26-1106, sponsored by Representatives Lindsay and Velasco and Senators Weissman and Michaelson Jenet, would strengthen eviction protections for Colorado tenants. It's currently assigned to the Judiciary Committee. This bill doesn't solve every problem. It doesn't establish right-to-counsel. It doesn't cap rent increases. But it addresses procedural protections that directly affect whether tenants get a fair process before losing their homes.

For context: Colorado state law (CRS 38-12-301) still prohibits cities from enacting any form of rent stabilization — a ban that's been in place since 1981. Four attempts to repeal it have failed, the closest being HB23-1115, which passed the full House in 2023 before dying by a single vote in a Senate committee. Denver renters have zero protection against unlimited rent increases. The least the state can do is ensure that when someone gets dragged into eviction court, the process is fair.

**The math**

An eviction costs Denver far more than the filing fee. Every completed eviction increases the likelihood of homelessness, and Denver spends an estimated $40,000 to $60,000 per person per year managing homelessness through emergency services. Permanent supportive housing costs $15,000 to $25,000. Preventing evictions is not just more humane — it's dramatically cheaper than cleaning up after them.

Fifteen thousand filings a year. Ninety percent of landlords with attorneys. Ten percent of tenants. A system that processes people like paperwork.

HB26-1106 is in committee. If you live in Colorado, your state legislators need to hear from you. You can text RESIST to 50409 and send a letter to your representatives in under two minutes. You can look up your specific legislators and their positions at leg.colorado.gov.

If you want the full policy breakdown — what other cities and countries do, what Denver could do if the state ban were lifted, and what's in the pipeline — denverforall.org has 49 data-driven proposals including housing, wages, healthcare, and public safety.

Forty families a day. We can do better than this.

**Subject:** Op-ed submission: Denver's eviction crisis by the numbers — timed to HB26-1106

Hi,

I'm submitting an op-ed (~800 words) on Denver's eviction crisis. My family was priced out of our apartment while searching for accessible housing for my son — rent jumped from $3,100 to over $5,400 in proposed terms. That personal experience led me to the systemic data: 15,000+ eviction filings in Denver County Court last year, 72% above pre-pandemic levels, with a 90-to-10 attorney representation gap. The piece is timed to HB26-1106, currently in the Judiciary Committee, and includes proof-city comparisons (New York, San Francisco) and the cost math connecting evictions to Denver's homelessness spending. Happy to discuss or adjust length.
