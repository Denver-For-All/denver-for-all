## Main Copy

Denver For All has built a complete civic platform on less than $840/year — 47 evidence-based policy proposals, 8 free interactive tools, 6 federal grant templates, and a bilingual organizing playbook serving 600+ unique visitors every week.

Your donation directly funds:

**Policy Research & Analysis** — Comprehensive, evidence-based proposals using the latest academic research, international case studies, and Denver-specific data. Every proposal includes cost-benefit analysis, implementation pathways, and answers to counterarguments.

**Free Civic Tools** — An eviction tracker, rent calculator, campaign finance transparency tracker, 24/7 bilingual tenant rights chatbot, candidate accountability trackers, and more. Built for Denver residents, not consultants.

**Bilingual Access** — Spanish translations ensuring all Denver residents can engage with policy research and civic tools. 30% of Denver's population is Hispanic/Latino.

**Grassroots Organizing** — Outreach infrastructure, Resistbot petition campaigns, community education, and direct action channels that turn research into real power.

We accept no corporate money. We are funded entirely by people like you.

## The Math: What a Dollar Does

Denver has ~715,000 residents. Through Resistbot, we can deliver a targeted policy petition to 40 Denver residents for $1.

| Donation | Residents Reached | % of Denver |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| $1 | 40 | 0.006% |
| $25 | 1,000 | 0.14% |
| $100 | 4,000 | 0.56% |
| $250 | 10,000 | 1.4% |
| $500 | 20,000 | 2.8% |
| $537 | 21,450 | **3%** |

Civic engagement research shows that when 3% of a population actively engages on a policy issue, outcomes shift. **$537 reaches that threshold for all of Denver on a single issue.** That means one motivated donor — or a handful of neighbors splitting the cost — can put a targeted petition in front of enough people to change the outcome.
