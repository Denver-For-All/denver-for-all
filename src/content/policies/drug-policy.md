## The Problem

The war on drugs has failed. Fifty years of criminalization have not reduced drug use - they've produced:
- Mass incarceration, disproportionately of Black and Latino men
- Overdose deaths at record levels (fentanyl is now the leading cause of death for Americans 18-45)
- A trillion dollars wasted on enforcement that doesn't work
- Stigma that prevents people from seeking help
- Criminal records that make recovery nearly impossible (can't get a job, can't get housing, can't get student loans)

Denver specifically faces an opioid/fentanyl crisis that law enforcement cannot arrest its way out of. Every dollar spent on arresting drug users is a dollar not spent on treatment beds, recovery programs, and harm reduction.

## Our Solution

### Denver Decriminalization & Harm Reduction Act

**1. Decriminalize Personal Possession**
- Possession of any substance in personal-use quantities is not a criminal offense in Denver
- Personal-use thresholds established by public health experts (not prosecutors)
- Possession remains a civil infraction with referral to treatment services - not jail
- Manufacturing and distribution remain criminal offenses
- This is the Portugal model: decriminalization + treatment investment = reduced overdose deaths, reduced HIV, reduced drug use

**2. Treatment on Demand**
- Anyone seeking substance use treatment can access it within 24 hours - no waitlists
- Full spectrum: detox, residential treatment, outpatient, medication-assisted treatment (MAT), peer support
- City-funded treatment beds to eliminate waitlists
- Treatment available regardless of insurance status or ability to pay
- Culturally competent, trauma-informed, multilingual services

**3. Safe Consumption Sites**
- Supervised consumption facilities where people can use substances under medical supervision
- Prevent overdose deaths (zero deaths have occurred in any supervised consumption site worldwide)
- Provide clean supplies, naloxone, wound care, and connection to treatment
- Reduce public drug use, discarded needles, and related public order concerns
- Legal under Denver's home rule authority (city can decline to prosecute)

**4. Naloxone Everywhere**
- Free naloxone (Narcan) available at all city buildings, libraries, community centers, transit stations
- Training for all first responders, city employees, and willing community members
- No questions asked, no ID required
- Vending machines with naloxone in high-need areas

**5. Expungement**
- Automatic expungement of all prior drug possession convictions in Denver courts
- No application required - city reviews all records and clears eligible convictions
- Immediate notification to affected individuals
- Assistance with record clearing for state and federal convictions (referral to legal services)

**6. Redirect Enforcement Budget**
- Close the Drug Enforcement unit within Denver Police
- Redirect $15-20M/year to treatment, harm reduction, and recovery services
- Police focus on violent crime and trafficking - not users

## How We Pay For It

**Budget reallocation:** Drug enforcement → treatment. Net new spending is minimal.
- Treatment on Demand: $20-30M/year (offset by reduced incarceration, emergency room, and law enforcement costs)
- Safe consumption sites: $3-5M/year (offset by reduced emergency response and hospital costs)
- Naloxone program: $1-2M/year
- Expungement: $2M one-time cost for record review

**Cost savings:** Incarceration costs $40K/year per person. Treatment costs $4-8K/year. Every person diverted from jail to treatment saves taxpayers $30K+/year.

**Portugal's results after decriminalization (2001):** HIV infections among drug users dropped 95%. Overdose deaths dropped by 80%. Drug use rates are below the European average. This works.

### International Evidence: Every Approach Works Better Than Criminalization

| Country | Model | Result |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **Portugal** (2001) | Decriminalized all drugs. Redirected enforcement budget to treatment. Dissuasion commissions (health professionals, not judges) meet with people caught using. | HIV infections among drug users dropped **95%**. Overdose deaths dropped **80%**. Drug use rates below EU average. Incarceration for drug offenses dropped dramatically. |
| **Switzerland** (1994) | Heroin-assisted treatment (HAT) - prescribed pharmaceutical heroin for severe addiction. Safe consumption sites in every major city. | Overdose deaths dropped **50%**. HIV transmission dropped **65%**. Crime associated with drug use dropped dramatically. Public support for the program exceeds 70%. |
| **Netherlands** | Pragmatic tolerance. Coffee shops sell cannabis legally. Safe consumption sites. Treatment emphasis. | Drug use rates comparable to strict-prohibition countries. Overdose deaths among lowest in Europe. System costs less than criminalization. |
| **Czech Republic** (2010) | Decriminalized personal possession of all drugs. Health-focused approach. | No increase in drug use. Reduced stigma. Better health outcomes for drug users. |
| **Canada** (Vancouver) | Insite supervised consumption site operating since 2003. Legal challenge reached Supreme Court (upheld). | 1,500+ overdose interventions. Zero deaths. 33% increase in detox program enrollment by nearby residents. Reduced public injection by 65%. |
| **USA** (Drug War, 1971-present) | Criminalization. $1 trillion+ spent on enforcement. Mass incarceration. | **Highest overdose death rate in the world. Highest incarceration rate on Earth. Drug use has not decreased.** The most expensive and least effective approach ever attempted. |

**Every single alternative approach - Portuguese decriminalization, Swiss harm reduction, Dutch pragmatism - produces better outcomes than American criminalization.** The evidence is not ambiguous. The war on drugs is the single most thoroughly disproven policy in modern history.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Won't this encourage drug use?"**
Portugal decriminalized all drugs in 2001. Drug use rates went DOWN. Decriminalization doesn't increase use - it removes the barrier to seeking help. People don't use drugs because they're legal. People avoid seeking treatment because they're afraid of jail.

**"Safe consumption sites sound extreme."**
There are over 200 supervised consumption sites operating in 14 countries. Zero overdose deaths have occurred in any of them. They reduce public drug use, reduce discarded needles, and connect people to treatment. They are the most evidence-supported intervention available.

**"What about dealers and traffickers?"**
This proposal decriminalizes personal use, not distribution. Manufacturing and trafficking remain criminal offenses. The distinction is simple: if you're sick, you need a doctor; if you're selling poison, you face consequences.
