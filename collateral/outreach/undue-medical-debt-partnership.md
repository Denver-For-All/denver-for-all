## Partnership Proposal Letter

**Subject:** Denver Medical Debt Campaign Partnership — Denver For All

Dear Undue Medical Debt team,

I'm reaching out to explore a partnership between Undue Medical Debt and Denver For All (denverforall.org) to launch a Denver-specific medical debt abolition campaign.

### The Opportunity

Denver For All is a grassroots civic organization with a detailed, evidence-based Medical Debt Forgiveness proposal that is classified as ready for immediate Denver City Council introduction. We have the policy research, community engagement infrastructure, and political analysis to advocate for a municipal medical debt purchase program — and Undue Medical Debt has the proven operational model to execute it.

### What We've Built

Our Medical Debt Forgiveness policy proposal includes:

- Cost-benefit analysis showing $5M can forgive $100–500M in medical debt
- Case studies from your partnerships with Toledo ($1.6M → $240M forgiven), New Orleans ($130M), LA County ($5M → $363M+), and others
- Denver-specific context: Denver Health still sends patients to collections and places liens on homes
- Evidence base: 62% of US bankruptcies involve medical debt (Himmelstein); hospital admissions reduce earnings 20% (Dobkin)
- Implementation pathway as a city council ordinance — one of 10 proposals we've identified as legally ready for immediate introduction

### What a Partnership Looks Like

**Phase 1 — Research & Advocacy (Now)**

- Denver For All uses our platform (~600 unique visitors/week, growing) and organizing channels to build public support for a Denver medical debt purchase program
- We engage Denver City Council members with our evidence-based proposal and your track record
- We launch Resistbot petition campaigns urging council to allocate funds

**Phase 2 — Council Action (2026–2027)**

- Council introduces an ordinance allocating $5M (or another amount) for medical debt purchase
- Potential funding sources: Denver's general fund, ARPA remaining funds, or dedicated revenue

**Phase 3 — Execution**

- Undue Medical Debt identifies and purchases qualifying Denver medical debt portfolios
- Debt abolished for Denver residents; impact reported publicly

### Why Denver

- Denver Health is a public hospital that still sends patients to collections — a city investing in debt abolition while reforming its own hospital's practices is a powerful narrative
- Colorado has no comprehensive medical debt protections at the state level
- Denver's 2027 municipal election creates political opportunity — candidates can champion this as a signature initiative
- The STAR program (mental health crisis response) has already demonstrated Denver's willingness to invest in alternatives — medical debt forgiveness is a natural next step

### What We Need From You

1. Data on medical debt burden specific to Denver County / metro Denver area
2. Estimated cost to purchase and abolish a meaningful portfolio of Denver medical debt
3. Willingness to be referenced as the executing partner in our council advocacy
4. Any model ordinance language or partnership frameworks from your government collaborations

### Our Reach

- ~600 unique weekly visitors to denverforall.org
- Active grassroots channels: Reddit, Signal, newsletter, Resistbot
- Bilingual English/Spanish platform (30% of Denver is Hispanic/Latino)
- Relationships being built with council members, the mayor's office, and Colorado's federal delegation

This partnership costs Undue Medical Debt nothing until a city appropriation is secured — we do the advocacy work to get there.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
Denver For All
