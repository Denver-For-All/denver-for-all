Our work directly addresses affordable housing, tenant protections, and homelessness solutions.

**Secondary: Economic Opportunity**
Our labor policy research covers living wage ($25/hr indexed to CPI), one fair wage (eliminating tipped minimums), sectoral bargaining, and gig worker protections — community wealth-building from the worker perspective.

## Application Narratives

*The Denver Foundation uses 2,500-character narrative questions submitted through their Grant Manager portal. The exact questions are only visible in the portal, but they center on constituent leadership, racial equity, community impact, and organizational health. Below are draft responses for the expected questions.*

### Organization Description (2,500 characters max)

Denver For All is a grassroots civic organization that produces evidence-based policy research, builds free interactive civic tools, and organizes communities in Denver to advance housing justice, economic equity, and government accountability.

We have developed 47 data-driven policy proposals spanning housing, labor, healthcare, public safety, immigration, infrastructure, and democratic governance. Each proposal is grounded in peer-reviewed research, international case studies, and Denver-specific data with full citations.

Our free civic tools directly serve Denver residents:
- An eviction tracker mapping displacement by neighborhood and landlord
- A rent calculator showing household savings under proposed rent stabilization
- A campaign finance tracker exposing money's influence on local politics
- A 24/7 AI tenant rights chatbot in English and Spanish
- Nonpartisan candidate accountability trackers for the 2027 election
- A sidewalk safety explorer mapping the 43% of Denver sidewalks that are missing or deficient

We also provide 6 ready-to-file federal grant templates (HUD HOME, HUD CoC, FEMA BRIC, BEAD, Safe Streets for All) that city staff, council members, and advocates can use to secure federal funding for Denver.

Denver For All operates on radical transparency: our entire platform is open source, all policy research is public, all tools are free, and we accept no corporate money. We currently reach approximately 600 unique visitors per week and are growing through grassroots outreach across social media, community groups, Spanish-language networks, and direct action channels including Resistbot petition campaigns.

Our legislative analysis classifies all 47 proposals by implementation pathway. Ten proposals can be introduced to city council immediately, including medical debt forgiveness, STAR program expansion, tenant anti-retaliation protections, and source-of-income discrimination bans. Two require ballot measures. Four require state legislation — including rent stabilization, currently blocked by Colorado's 1981 preemption (CRS § 38-12-301).

We are seeking general operating support to scale our AI-powered research capacity, expand bilingual access, and deepen community engagement as we prepare for the 2027 municipal election cycle.

### Constituent Leadership (2,500 characters max)

Denver For All was built by and for the people most affected by Denver's housing and economic crises — renters, low-wage workers, immigrants, and residents in high-displacement neighborhoods.

**Community-driven design:** Every policy proposal begins with the lived experience of Denver residents. Our rent calculator was built so tenants can see exactly how rent stabilization would affect their household. Our eviction tracker maps displacement patterns in the specific neighborhoods — Montbello, Green Valley Ranch, Globeville, Elyria-Swansea, Westwood — where residents face the highest displacement risk. Our tenant rights chatbot is available 24/7 in both English and Spanish because 30% of Denver's population is Hispanic/Latino and language access is a justice issue.

**Community input channels:** We maintain active engagement with Denver residents through multiple channels: a Reddit community, a Signal organizing group for direct communication, email newsletter, and Resistbot petition campaigns that turn individual concerns into collective action. Our candidate trackers publish unedited candidate responses — voters see exactly what candidates say, with no editorial filter.

**Neighborhood-level outreach:** Our organizing playbook includes targeted outreach to neighborhood-specific Facebook groups, Nextdoor communities, and Spanish-language networks including partnerships with organizations like Clinica Tepeyac, Centro Humanitario, CIRC, Padres & Jóvenes Unidos, and Focus Points Family Resource Center.

**Open source as constituent power:** All of our policy research, tools, and code are public. Any Denver resident, council member, or advocate can use, adapt, or build on our work. This is constituent leadership through radical accessibility — the research and tools belong to the community, not to us.

**Direct action infrastructure:** Our Resistbot integration allows any resident to send pre-written letters to their elected officials in under 60 seconds. We are expanding from 5 to 15–20 campaign templates covering housing, wages, healthcare, and public safety — each drafted from community-identified priorities.

### Racial Equity (2,500 characters max)

Racial equity is embedded in Denver For All's mission, research methodology, and organizational practice.

**The problem is racialized:** Denver's housing and economic crises disproportionately impact communities of color. Hispanic/Latino residents — 30% of Denver's population — face displacement from historically Latino neighborhoods like Globeville, Elyria-Swansea, and Westwood where development and gentrification have accelerated. Black residents face eviction at disproportionate rates. Immigrant communities face exploitation compounded by language barriers and fear of enforcement.

**Our research centers racial impact:** Each policy proposal analyzes differential impacts across racial and ethnic communities. Our eviction tracker maps displacement patterns that reveal racialized geography. Our campaign finance tracker exposes how real estate PAC money — which increased 380% in outside spending from 2019–2023 — drives policy decisions that accelerate displacement in communities of color. Our law enforcement settlement tracker shows $35.3M paid out from 2017–2023 ($17.3M in 2023 alone), costs borne by taxpayers while harms concentrate in Black and Latino neighborhoods.

**Bilingual access as racial equity:** Our entire platform provides English/Spanish language toggle. Our tenant rights chatbot operates in both languages 24/7. We are prioritizing professional translation of our 5 flagship policies (Social Housing, Rent Stabilization, Living Wage, Healthcare, Immigration/Sanctuary) to ensure Spanish-speaking residents have equal access to policy information.

**Policy priorities reflect racial justice:** Our platform includes dedicated proposals for reparations and racial justice, sanctuary city protections, immigration anti-exploitation, newcomer reception services, and workforce integration for immigrants. Our STAR program expansion proposal specifically addresses the Urban Institute finding that arrest reductions are 2–3x larger for homeless populations — who are disproportionately BIPOC.

**Community partnerships:** Our outreach strategy prioritizes relationships with BIPOC-led organizations rather than extractive engagement. We identify partner organizations in our organizing playbook and approach collaboration as supporting existing community leadership, not replacing it.

### Community Impact & Outcomes (2,500 characters max)

Denver For All's impact operates at three levels: individual empowerment, systemic transparency, and policy change.

**Individual empowerment:**
- Eviction tracker: Tenants facing eviction can identify patterns — which landlords file most often, which neighborhoods are most affected — and connect to defense resources
- Rent calculator: Households can model exact savings under proposed rent stabilization, converting abstract policy into concrete personal impact
- Tenant rights chatbot: 24/7 access to legal information in English and Spanish — residents don't need to wait for business hours or navigate complex legal resources
- Know Your Rights: Accessible guidance on eviction defense, repair demands, deposit recovery, and discrimination complaints

**Systemic transparency:**
- Campaign finance tracker: Voters can see exactly who funds their council members and how those members vote on housing, wages, and public safety
- Money in Denver Politics data story: Documents the 380% increase in outside spending and real estate PAC influence that shapes Denver policy
- Candidate trackers: Standardized surveys ensure all candidates answer the same questions — no spin, no selective engagement

**Policy change pathway:**
- 10 proposals classified as ready for immediate city council introduction, with specific filing sequence
- 6 federal grant templates that can bring $8–12M+ in federal funding to Denver for housing, broadband, transportation, and emergency preparedness
- Legislative history analysis (rent control preemption) providing strategic roadmap for state-level advocacy
- Comprehensive evidence base that council members, the mayor's office, and state legislators can reference when drafting legislation

**Measurable outcomes with grant support:**
- Expand bilingual policy translations from partial to complete for top 10 proposals
- Increase weekly unique visitors from 600 to 2,000+ through funded outreach
- Deploy all 15–20 Resistbot petition campaigns covering full platform
- Complete candidate tracker coverage for all 13 council districts ahead of 2027 election
- Support introduction of at least 3 Tier 1 proposals to Denver City Council

### Organizational Financial Health (2,500 characters max)

Denver For All demonstrates exceptional financial efficiency and sustainability.

**Current operating model:** We have built a comprehensive civic platform — 47 policy proposals, 8 interactive tools, 6 federal grant templates, a bilingual organizing playbook — on an annual budget of $310–840. This is possible because:
- Hosting: Cloudflare Pages (free tier)
- Backend: Cloudflare Workers + D1 database (free tier)
- Newsletter: EmailOctopus (free tier, 2,500 subscribers)
- Email: Cloudflare email routing (free)
- Only paid service: vAPI voice AI for tenant chatbot ($300–720/year)

**Revenue diversification plan:** We are pursuing fiscal sponsorship through Social Good Fund to unlock tax-deductible donations and foundation grant eligibility. Revenue sources will include:
- Small-dollar individual donations via ActBlue/Givebutter
- Foundation grants (Denver Foundation, Caring for Denver Foundation, Fund for Housing and Opportunity, Colorado Health Foundation)
- No corporate money — this is a permanent organizational commitment

**Financial controls:** Under Social Good Fund's Model A fiscal sponsorship, all financial management, tax filing, and compliance are handled by SGF's professional staff. This provides donor confidence and foundation-grade financial oversight without the overhead of standalone nonprofit administration.

**Scalability:** Our technology stack is designed for near-zero marginal cost scaling. Cloudflare's free tier handles significant traffic. Our primary scaling cost is AI-powered research (Claude API tokens), which directly produces the policy research, analysis, and civic tools that define our impact. A $20,000–$50,000 grant would fund 1–2 years of expanded research, complete bilingual translations, and full community outreach deployment.

**Sustainability:** Even without grant funding, our core platform continues operating at under $840/year. Grant support accelerates impact — it doesn't create dependency. Every tool we build, every policy we publish, and every grant template we create remains permanently available as a free public resource regardless of future funding.
