## The Problem

Technology was supposed to give us more free time. Instead, it erased the boundary between work and life. Denver workers are expected to answer emails at 10 PM, respond to Slack messages on vacation, and be "available" 24/7. The result: burnout is an epidemic, mental health is deteriorating, and productivity is actually declining because exhausted people don't do good work.

Americans work 400+ more hours per year than German workers. That's 10 extra weeks. We are not 10 weeks more productive - we're just 10 weeks more tired.

### What Denver Currently Does

Denver has **no right-to-disconnect protections or reduced work week provisions**. Colorado does not regulate after-hours work communications. Denver city employees work a standard 40-hour week.

The OECD reports that US workers average 1,811 hours/year compared to Germany's 1,349 hours/year -- a difference of 462 hours, or more than 11 standard 40-hour work weeks (OECD, *Hours Worked* indicator, 2023).

## Our Solution

### 1. Denver Right to Disconnect Ordinance

Adapted from France's *Droit à la déconnexion* (law since 2017):

- **After-hours protection:** Employers with 20+ employees must establish clear "disconnect" hours. Outside those hours, employees have no obligation to respond to work communications.
- **No retaliation:** Employees cannot be disciplined, passed over for promotion, or terminated for not responding during disconnect hours.
- **Emergency exception:** Genuine, defined emergencies only - not "the client wants an update."
- **Negotiated implementation:** Employers work with workers (and works councils where they exist) to define disconnect policies appropriate to their industry.
- **City employees first:** Denver implements right to disconnect for all 12,000+ city employees immediately as a model.

**France's results since 2017:** Worker satisfaction increased, burnout decreased, and productivity did not decrease. Companies report clearer communication and better time management because managers can't use late-night emails as a substitute for planning.

### 2. The 32-Hour Work Week

Phase in a 32-hour standard work week for Denver, starting with city employees and contractors.

**Phase-in:**
- Year 1: City employees move to 32-hour/4-day week at same pay
- Year 2: City contractors with 50+ employees must offer 32-hour option
- Year 3: All Denver businesses with 50+ employees implement 32-hour standard (overtime begins at 32 hours)

**Same pay, fewer hours.** This is not a pay cut. The evidence shows productivity per hour INCREASES when hours decrease, resulting in the same or greater total output.

## The Evidence: This Works

| Trial/Country | What They Did | Result |
|--------------|---------------|--------|
| **Iceland (2015-2019)** | 2,500 workers moved to 35-36hr weeks. Largest trial in modern history. | Productivity maintained or IMPROVED. Worker wellbeing dramatically improved. Iceland subsequently passed legislation giving workers right to negotiate shorter hours. |
| **UK 4-Day Week Pilot (2022)** | 61 companies, 2,900 workers. 6-month trial. | 92% of companies continued the policy permanently. Revenue stayed the same or increased. 71% of employees reported reduced burnout. |
| **Spain (2023-ongoing)** | Government-funded 4-day week pilot for small and medium businesses. | Early results: productivity maintained, reduced absenteeism, lower energy costs. |
| **Belgium (2022)** | Legal right for workers to compress full-time hours into 4 days. | Workers exercising the right report higher satisfaction, better work-life balance. |
| **France Right to Disconnect (2017)** | Workers have legal right to ignore after-hours communications. | Reduced burnout, improved boundaries, no productivity loss. Extended to Italy (2017), Spain (2021), Portugal (2021), Belgium (2022). |
| **Microsoft Japan (2019)** | Closed offices every Friday for a month. | Productivity increased by 40%. Electricity costs dropped 23%. |

**The pattern is unambiguous:** When people work fewer hours with the same pay, they produce the same output in less time, are healthier, happier, and less likely to quit. Every single major trial has confirmed this.

### Why It Works (The Economics)

Most knowledge workers are productive for 4-6 hours per day. The remaining time is spent in unnecessary meetings, context switching, performative busyness, and recovering from interruptions. A 32-hour week forces organizations to:
- Eliminate unnecessary meetings
- Communicate more efficiently
- Respect focused work time
- Measure output instead of hours

For physical labor: reduced hours mean fewer injuries, lower absenteeism, and higher quality work. Tired workers make mistakes. Rested workers don't.

## How We Pay For It

**For city employees:** $0 net cost. Same output in fewer hours = same cost of service delivery. Reduced overtime, sick leave, and turnover may actually SAVE money.

**For private employers:** This is a regulation, not a spending program. Small business exemptions during phase-in. The evidence consistently shows that productivity per dollar of labor cost does not decrease.

**Overtime threshold change:** Moving the overtime threshold from 40 to 32 hours means workers who do work longer weeks earn premium pay - incentivizing employers to hire more people or reduce hours.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Denver can't unilaterally change the work week."**
Denver can set the work week for 12,000+ city employees, all city contractors, and establish local overtime thresholds. Federal FLSA sets a floor (40 hours before overtime), but states and cities can set lower thresholds. Several states are considering 32-hour work week legislation right now.

**"Service businesses can't do this."**
They hire more people. If a restaurant needs 7-day coverage, it hires for 4-day shifts instead of 5-day shifts. This increases total employment - which is a benefit, not a cost.

**"This is unrealistic."**
It was the standard work week 100 years ago. The 40-hour week was considered radical when it was introduced. Before that, 60-80 hour weeks were "normal." Progress means working smarter, not longer. Every country with shorter work weeks has a higher quality of life than the US.

**"Workers will just get second jobs."**
Some might, and that's their choice. The goal is ensuring that one full-time job provides a living wage (see: $25 Minimum Wage) so that no one NEEDS a second job. If people want additional income, a 4-day week gives them that flexibility.

**"What about salaried/exempt workers?"**
The 32-hour overtime threshold primarily affects hourly workers under the FLSA. For salaried exempt workers, the Right to Disconnect ordinance is the key protection -- establishing clear boundaries between work and personal time. Additionally, Denver can set its own exemption thresholds: workers earning below a specified salary level would be reclassified as non-exempt under the 32-hour standard, extending overtime protections to more workers.

**"What about healthcare, emergency services, and 24/7 operations?"**
Essential services operate on shift schedules, not standard work weeks. A 32-hour standard means four 8-hour shifts instead of five -- with staffing adjusted accordingly. Healthcare workers, firefighters, and police already work compressed schedules in many jurisdictions. The right to disconnect includes defined emergency exceptions for roles requiring on-call availability.
