Translate the following content from English to **Simplified Chinese (简体中文)**.

Language-specific guidelines:
- Use formal written Simplified Chinese appropriate for civic/government communication (公文体/正式书面语)
- Use Simplified Chinese characters (简体字), not Traditional
- For civic/legal terms, use standard PRC administrative terminology (e.g., "policy" → "政策", "legislation" → "立法", "ordinance" → "条例")
- "Denver For All" → keep as "Denver For All" (do not translate the project name)
- For section headings like "The Problem" / "Our Solution" / "How We Pay For It", use: "问题" / "我们的解决方案" / "资金来源"
- For U.S.-specific terms, use standard Chinese translations used by Chinese-language media in the US (e.g., "City Council" → "市议会", "Mayor" → "市长", "county" → "县")
- Keep monetary amounts in USD format ($XX,XXX) — do not convert to RMB
- Chinese text is typically more compact than English — this is expected, do not pad
