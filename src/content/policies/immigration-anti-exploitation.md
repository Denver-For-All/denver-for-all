## The Problem

Immigrant workers in Denver are systematically exploited. Employers steal their wages, knowing they won't complain. Landlords pack them into overcrowded, unsafe housing, knowing they won't call code enforcement. Labor traffickers control them through debt, document confiscation, and threats of deportation. The exploitation is not incidental - it is a business model that relies on fear and legal vulnerability.

The scale is staggering:
- Wage theft costs U.S. workers an estimated $50 billion annually - more than all robberies, burglaries, and motor vehicle thefts combined (Economic Policy Institute, 2017). Immigrant workers are disproportionately victimized.
- The construction industry, one of Denver's largest employers of immigrant labor, has among the highest rates of wage theft, misclassification, and safety violations in the country (Colorado Fiscal Institute, 2022).
- An estimated 11,000+ people are victims of labor trafficking in Colorado at any given time, concentrated in agriculture, construction, domestic work, restaurants, and massage businesses (Colorado Human Trafficking Council, 2023).
- Overcrowded and unsafe housing targeting immigrant tenants - illegal basement apartments, subdivided units without permits, buildings with serious code violations - is widespread in Denver neighborhoods like Globeville, Elyria-Swansea, Westwood, and southwest Denver.
- Workers who report abuse face retaliation: termination, threats to call ICE, blacklisting within immigrant labor networks controlled by exploitative employers.

Current enforcement is fragmented, underfunded, and reactive. The city's wage theft enforcement relies on individual complaints from workers who are afraid to come forward. Labor trafficking investigations are led by federal agencies that immigrant communities don't trust. Housing code enforcement is complaint-driven in a population that fears any contact with government.

### What Denver Currently Does

Denver's Auditor's Office handles wage theft complaints, but the office is not specifically resourced for immigrant worker cases and does not conduct proactive industry investigations. The Denver District Attorney's office prosecutes labor trafficking cases but relies primarily on federal referrals. Denver's code enforcement operates on a complaint basis, which systematically under-serves communities where residents fear government contact.

Colorado passed the Wage Theft Transparency Act (SB 22-161) strengthening wage theft penalties, and Denver's wage theft ordinance allows workers to recover stolen wages. But enforcement depends on workers filing complaints - which immigrant workers, especially undocumented workers, rarely do. The Colorado Human Trafficking Council coordinates statewide efforts but has limited enforcement capacity. There is no dedicated city-level task force focused on labor exploitation of immigrant workers.

### Who Opposes This (and Why)

Some employers in construction, hospitality, and food service benefit directly from exploitable immigrant labor and will oppose stronger enforcement. Industry associations may frame proactive enforcement as burdensome regulation. Some landlords profit from overcrowded immigrant housing and will resist inspection regimes. Counter: legitimate businesses are harmed by competitors who undercut them through wage theft and worker exploitation. Proactive enforcement levels the playing field. And the cost of exploitation - in emergency healthcare for injured workers, in homelessness from housing exploitation, in the human toll of trafficking - is borne by the public.

## Our Solution

### The Denver Worker Protection & Anti-Trafficking Act

**1. Immigrant Worker Protection Unit**
- Dedicated enforcement unit within Denver's Auditor's Office (or housed in a new Office of Worker Protection) focused on wage theft, labor law violations, and exploitation in industries with high immigrant employment
- Staffed with multilingual investigators (Spanish, Portuguese, Haitian Creole minimum)
- Proactive investigation authority: the unit conducts industry sweeps and audits, not just complaint-driven investigations
- Priority industries: construction, restaurants and food service, hospitality/hotels, janitorial/cleaning services, meatpacking/food processing, domestic work, car washes, and landscaping
- Undercover capacity to investigate employers suspected of systematic exploitation
- Annual public report on enforcement actions, recovered wages, and industry compliance trends

**2. Worker Misclassification Crackdown**
- Proactive audits of construction companies and other industries that misclassify employees as independent contractors to avoid paying minimum wage, overtime, workers' compensation, and payroll taxes
- Estimated that 20-40% of construction workers in Colorado are misclassified (Colorado Fiscal Institute, 2022), costing workers benefits and protections and costing the state and city millions in lost tax revenue
- Penalties: companies found misclassifying workers face fines, debarment from city contracts, and public listing on a "bad actor" registry
- Rebuttable presumption: workers in designated industries are presumed to be employees unless the company proves independent contractor status under the ABC test
- Partnership with Colorado Department of Labor for coordinated enforcement

**3. Safe Reporting & Anti-Retaliation**
- Immigration status is irrelevant in all city labor enforcement proceedings - guaranteed by ordinance, not just policy
- Workers who report wage theft, unsafe conditions, or exploitation receive a city-issued "cooperating witness" letter that documents their cooperation with law enforcement (supporting U-visa and T-visa applications for federal immigration relief)
- Anti-retaliation protections: employers who threaten workers with deportation, termination, or blacklisting for reporting violations face enhanced penalties (treble damages + $10,000 per violation)
- Anonymous reporting hotline and online portal in multiple languages, operated by a community organization (not the city) to maximize trust
- Community-based outreach: trained promotores (community health workers) and worker center staff conduct regular know-your-rights sessions in immigrant neighborhoods, churches, and community gathering places

**4. Labor Trafficking Task Force**
- City-level task force dedicated to investigating labor trafficking, coordinating with but independent from federal agencies
- Survivor-centered approach: trafficking victims receive immediate access to shelter, legal representation, medical care, and social services - not detention or deportation
- Partnerships with community organizations that have existing relationships with at-risk populations
- Focus on industries where trafficking is concentrated: massage businesses, domestic work, agriculture (in metro area), restaurants, and construction
- Training for Denver police, fire, building inspectors, and health inspectors to recognize trafficking indicators during routine duties
- Annual trafficking assessment identifying trends, at-risk populations, and enforcement gaps

**5. Housing Exploitation Enforcement**
- Proactive housing inspection program targeting properties in neighborhoods with high immigrant populations, focusing on:
  - Overcrowding beyond legal occupancy limits
  - Illegal basement apartments and unpermitted subdivisions
  - Serious code violations: no heat, no hot water, electrical hazards, pest infestations, lead paint, mold
  - Rent-by-the-bed or rent-by-the-shift arrangements that violate housing codes
- Tenant protections: tenants in exploitative housing cannot be evicted during the remediation period. Landlords must provide alternative housing or relocation assistance if units are condemned.
- Penalties for landlords: fines scaling with severity, mandatory repairs, and for repeat offenders, receivership (city takes control of the property)
- Immigration-status-blind enforcement: tenants' immigration status is never asked, recorded, or shared during housing inspections
- Connection to the Denver Tenant Bill of Rights and anti-displacement protections

**6. Construction Industry Accountability**
- Denver construction permits require certification of compliance with wage, hour, and safety laws
- Contractors with unresolved wage theft claims are denied new permits until claims are resolved
- Prevailing wage requirements for all city-funded construction projects
- Safety enforcement: multilingual OSHA-standard safety training required on all Denver construction sites; city inspectors verify compliance
- Workers' compensation verification: contractors must demonstrate active workers' comp coverage for all workers before permit issuance
- Subcontractor liability: general contractors are jointly liable for wage theft and safety violations by their subcontractors on Denver projects

### Evidence: Enforcement Protects Workers and Economies

| City/Country | Model | Result |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| **San Francisco** | Office of Labor Standards Enforcement (OLSE) conducts proactive industry investigations, not just complaint-driven enforcement. Dedicated staff for immigrant worker cases. Strong anti-retaliation protections. | Recovered $28M+ in stolen wages in a single year. Proactive enforcement found violations in 80%+ of investigated businesses in target industries (SF OLSE, 2023). |
| **Seattle** | Office of Labor Standards with proactive investigation authority. Strategic enforcement targeting industries with high violation rates. Community partnerships for outreach. | Recovered $50M+ in stolen wages since inception. Workers in target industries saw measurable wage increases even without individual complaints, as employer compliance improved industry-wide (Seattle OLS, 2023). |
| **United Kingdom** | Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA) licenses and regulates labor providers in high-risk industries. Proactive inspections and criminal investigations. | Dramatic reduction in severe labor exploitation in regulated industries. Licensing model prevents bad actors from entering the market rather than chasing them after exploitation occurs (GLAA, 2022). |
| **New York City** | Department of Consumer and Worker Protection conducts proactive investigations. Paid Safe and Sick Leave law covers all workers regardless of status. Construction safety task force. | Recovered $50M+ for workers in a single year. Construction fatalities decreased after targeted enforcement. Model shows that proactive enforcement produces 5-10x more recovery than complaint-driven systems (NYC DCWP, 2023). |

**The evidence is overwhelming:** proactive enforcement recovers more stolen wages, deters more exploitation, and protects more workers than complaint-driven systems. When enforcement relies on individual complaints, exploited immigrant workers bear all the risk. Proactive enforcement shifts the burden to employers - where it belongs.

## How We Pay For It

- Immigrant Worker Protection Unit: $3M/year (investigators, multilingual staff, legal support)
- Worker Misclassification audits: $1M/year (partially offset by recovered penalties and tax revenue)
- Safe Reporting infrastructure: $500K/year (hotline, outreach, community partnerships)
- Labor Trafficking Task Force: $2M/year (investigators, victim services, training)
- Housing Exploitation Enforcement: $2M/year (inspectors, legal support, relocation assistance)
- Construction Industry Accountability: $1M/year (permit verification, compliance monitoring)
- **Total: ~$9.5M/year**

**Revenue offset:** San Francisco and Seattle recover tens of millions annually through enforcement penalties and back-wage recovery. Denver's program should recover $5-15M/year in stolen wages returned to workers and penalties collected from violating employers. Worker misclassification enforcement recovers millions in unpaid payroll taxes. The program partially or fully pays for itself through enforcement revenue.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Won't proactive enforcement hurt small businesses?"**
Proactive enforcement targets systematic exploitation - not paperwork mistakes. Small businesses that pay their workers fairly have nothing to fear and everything to gain. Right now, exploitative businesses undercut legitimate competitors by stealing from their workers. Enforcement levels the playing field. Denver's construction industry has honest contractors who lose bids to companies that save money through wage theft and misclassification. Those honest contractors support enforcement.

**"Why focus on immigrant workers specifically?"**
Because they're the most exploited and the least likely to come forward under complaint-driven systems. A construction worker who is undocumented isn't going to file a wage theft complaint if they think it might lead to deportation. Proactive enforcement removes that burden. The protections benefit all workers - wage theft doesn't only happen to immigrants - but the enforcement strategy must account for the specific vulnerabilities of immigrant workers.

**"Isn't labor trafficking a federal issue?"**
Federal agencies investigate trafficking, but they're focused on large-scale international operations and they're part of a system (DHS, ICE) that immigrant communities fundamentally distrust. A city-level task force with community partnerships and a survivor-centered approach can reach victims that federal agencies never will. City and federal efforts are complementary, not duplicative.

**"What about workers who are in the country illegally? Should they have the same rights?"**
Yes. Labor rights are human rights, and they apply to all workers in Denver regardless of immigration status. This isn't just a moral position - it's practical. When any class of workers can be exploited without consequence, it drags down wages and conditions for everyone. Employers who exploit undocumented workers don't stop there - they create a race to the bottom that harms all workers in the industry. Protecting every worker protects every worker.

**"Won't housing enforcement displace tenants if their housing is condemned?"**
The policy explicitly prevents this. Tenants in exploitative housing cannot be evicted during remediation. If units are condemned, landlords must provide alternative housing or relocation assistance. The goal is to fix unsafe housing, not punish the people living in it. The housing exploitation enforcement connects to the Denver Tenant Bill of Rights and anti-displacement zone protections.
