# Deliverable 2: Comment Spears

**Purpose:** 12 pre-written, data-loaded comments ready to deploy when specific types of local news stories appear. Each spear can be dropped (with minor customization) on Denver7, 9NEWS, CBS Colorado, Denver Post, or Denverite story comment sections.

**Rules (from the playbook and news comment strategy assessment):**
- Every comment includes at least ONE specific statistic with year, ONE proof city or international comparison, and ONE Denver-specific data point
- Lead with the problem and data, not the organization
- The link to denverforall.org is the "if you want more" — never the lead
- Only deploy on stories where the policy connection is direct and obvious
- No vague aspirational language. Concrete mechanisms, dollar amounts, named examples only.

### Spear 1: Rent Increase
**Deploy when:** Any story about rent increases, housing costs, affordability crisis, or renters being priced out of Denver neighborhoods
**Policy connection:** Denver Rent Stabilization Act (`rent-control.md`)
**Target outlets:** Denver Post, Denverite, Denver7, 9NEWS (all cover housing regularly)

**The comment:**
> Denver rents are up roughly 85% since 2010 (Zillow ZORI data) and there's literally nothing stopping your landlord from raising rent by any amount — Colorado banned cities from passing rent stabilization in 1981 (CRS § 38-12-301). Denver can't protect renters even if city council wanted to. The closest we got to repealing it was HB23-1115, which passed the full House in 2023 and got killed by one vote in a Senate committee. Meanwhile, Vienna caps rent on 60% of its housing stock, has virtually no homelessness, and was just named the world's most livable city again. We're one of the only states where there's zero protection. Not a weak protection — zero.

**Customization notes:** If the story mentions a specific dollar amount for a rent increase, open with "A $[X] rent increase with 60 days notice. That's legal in Colorado." If the story names a neighborhood, add: "This is happening across [neighborhood] right now."

### Spear 2: Eviction
**Deploy when:** Any story about eviction filings, eviction court, tenant displacement, or landlord-tenant disputes
**Policy connection:** Tenant Bill of Rights (`tenant-bill-of-rights.md`), Rent Stabilization (`rent-control.md`)
**Target outlets:** Denverite, Denver Post, CBS Colorado (Denverite covers eviction court closely)

**The comment:**
> Denver County Court processed over 15,000 eviction filings in 2025 — that's 72% above pre-pandemic levels. And here's the kicker: over 90% of landlords show up to eviction court with an attorney. Fewer than 10% of tenants do. That's not a fair legal process, it's an assembly line. Cities with right-to-counsel laws — like New York and San Francisco — see 30-40% fewer evictions just by giving tenants a lawyer. Denver has an eviction tracker at denverforall.org/tools/evictions where you can see the filings by neighborhood and landlord. The data is public. The scale of it is what most people don't realize until they see the numbers.

**Customization notes:** If the story profiles a specific evicted tenant, lead with empathy before the data. If the story mentions a specific neighborhood, reference the eviction tracker data for that area.

### Spear 3: Homelessness / Sweeps
**Deploy when:** Any story about encampment sweeps, homelessness counts, homeless individuals, or shelter capacity
**Policy connection:** Housing First (`housing-first.md`)
**Target outlets:** All Denver outlets (homelessness is a constant beat)

**The comment:**
> The math on sweeps is wild when you actually look at it. Denver spends an estimated $40,000-60,000 per person per year managing homelessness through emergency services — ER visits, jail, police, shelters. Permanent supportive housing costs $15,000-25,000. We're paying more to NOT house people. Finland adopted Housing First in 2008, cut homelessness by 35%, and is the only EU country where the numbers are going down. Houston housed 25,000+ people since 2012 using the same model — reduced homelessness by 63%. Every sweep costs $30,000-50,000 in city resources and just moves people to the next block. We know what works. We're choosing not to do it.

**Customization notes:** If the story mentions a specific sweep location, reference that neighborhood. If it quotes a cost figure for shelter operations, compare it to the $15-25K Housing First cost. If there's a PIT count update, use the new number.

**Related tool to mention:** None (but connect to eviction tracker if the story discusses the pipeline from eviction to homelessness)

### Spear 4: Wages / Cost of Living
**Deploy when:** Any story about cost of living, low wages, workers struggling, or minimum wage discussion
**Policy connection:** $25 Minimum Wage (`living-wage.md`), One Fair Wage (`one-fair-wage.md`)
**Target outlets:** Denver7, 9NEWS, Denver Post, Denverite

**The comment:**
> MIT's Living Wage Calculator says a family of four in Denver needs $25-26/hr with both parents working (livingwage.mit.edu). Denver minimum wage is $18.81. That's a $7/hr gap between what people earn and what they need — and that's the two-income scenario. Single parent with one kid? MIT says $42-44/hr. Seven states already eliminated the tipped minimum wage entirely and their restaurant industries are fine — employment actually grew faster. Denmark pays fast food workers $22/hr and a Big Mac costs 80 cents more. We act like paying people enough to live is radical when most of the developed world already figured it out.

**Customization notes:** If the story focuses on a specific industry (restaurants, healthcare, childcare), adjust the comparison. For childcare workers specifically: "Childcare workers in Denver make $13-16/hr — less than fast food workers — for the most critical stage of human development."

### Spear 5: Medical Debt
**Deploy when:** Any story about medical bills, hospital billing practices, medical debt collections, or healthcare costs
**Policy connection:** Healthcare as a Right (`healthcare.md`)
**Target outlets:** Denver Post, Denver7, 9NEWS, CBS Colorado

**The comment:**
> There's a real solution to this that other cities have already done. Toledo forgave $240 million in medical debt for a $1.6 million city investment. New Orleans, Chicago, Cook County — a growing list of cities partner with Undue Medical Debt to buy debt portfolios at pennies on the dollar (debt buyers pay 1-5 cents per dollar) and just cancel them. No strings attached. A $5 million Denver appropriation could forgive $100-500 million in medical debt. Meanwhile, Denver Health is a public hospital and it still sends patients to collections and places liens on homes. Every other wealthy country has zero medical bankruptcies. The US has 530,000 a year. The mechanism to fix this exists. The precedent exists. The money exists.

**Customization notes:** If the story involves a specific hospital, name it. If it involves Denver Health specifically, emphasize that it's a public hospital using public resources to pursue patients for debt. If the bill amount is mentioned, compare it to the pennies-on-the-dollar buyback cost.

### Spear 6: Mental Health / Police Response
**Deploy when:** Any story about police responding to mental health crises, STAR program, crisis response, or police encounters with mentally ill or homeless individuals
**Policy connection:** Community Safety & Police Reform (`public-safety.md`), Healthcare (`healthcare.md`)
**Target outlets:** Denverite, Denver Post, CBS Colorado, CPR News

**The comment:**
> Denver actually has a program that works for exactly this. The STAR program sends mental health professionals and paramedics instead of police for non-violent crisis calls. A 2026 Urban Institute evaluation — the first study nationwide to measure individual-level outcomes — found STAR reduces subsequent arrests by 16%, with 2-3x larger impacts for people experiencing homelessness. Cost: $237 per STAR van response vs. $1,011 for an average arrest. They've responded to over 23,000 calls since going citywide. The problem? STAR is funded at $4.4M/year and can only cover about 45% of eligible calls. The program needs 9-10 concurrent van units to meet demand but runs 6-7. We have proven evidence that this works and we're choosing to half-fund it.

**Customization notes:** If the story involves a specific incident where police responded to a mental health call, open with: "This is exactly the kind of call STAR was built for." If the story is about STAR specifically, focus on the funding gap and expansion needs. If it's a police shooting or use-of-force against a mentally ill person, add the Ruderman Foundation statistic: "People with disabilities make up 1/3 to 1/2 of all people killed by police."

### Spear 7: Broadband / Internet
**Deploy when:** Any story about Comcast complaints, internet pricing, digital divide, broadband access, or ISP service issues
**Policy connection:** Municipal Broadband (`municipal-broadband.md`)
**Target outlets:** Denver7, 9NEWS, Westword, Denver Post

**The comment:**
> Fun fact most Denverites don't know: we already voted to authorize municipal broadband. Ballot Measure 2J, 2018, passed with 85% of the vote. Seven years later we're still paying Comcast $80-120/month for internet with data caps. Longmont — 30 miles north — built NextLight: $50/month gigabit, no data caps, profitable within 5 years, 90%+ customer satisfaction. Fort Collins built theirs despite Comcast spending $150 million trying to stop it. Over 900 US communities have municipal broadband and they consistently outperform private ISPs. Denver voters said yes. City hall did nothing. That's not a technology problem or a funding problem — it's a political will problem.

**Customization notes:** If the story is about a specific Comcast outage or price hike, lead with the price comparison. If it's about the digital divide or low-income access, emphasize: "The Denver proposal includes a free tier for low-income households at $0/month and a basic tier at $15/month." If a councilmember or mayor candidate takes a position on broadband, reference the 85% voter mandate.

### Spear 8: Childcare / Education Costs
**Deploy when:** Any story about childcare costs, childcare deserts, daycare closures, preschool access, or working parents struggling with care
**Policy connection:** Universal Childcare (`universal-childcare.md`)
**Target outlets:** Denver7, 9NEWS, Denverite, Denver Post

**The comment:**
> Childcare in Denver runs $1,400-2,200/month per child — that's $16,800-26,400/year, more than in-state tuition at CU Boulder. And the people taking care of your kids earn $13-16/hr, which is poverty wages (BLS, 2024). The system is broken for everyone: too expensive for parents, poverty wages for workers, worse outcomes than countries that invest publicly. Colorado's Universal Pre-K covers 4-year-olds for 15 hours a week. CCCAP has waitlists and income cutoffs that exclude most working families. There's nothing for the 6-month to 3-year gap. Quebec introduced $7/day universal childcare in 1997 — 70,000 more mothers entered the workforce and the increased tax revenue exceeded the program's cost. Every $1 invested in early childhood returns $7-13 (Nobel laureate James Heckman, 2006). This isn't an expense. It's the highest-return public investment available.

**Customization notes:** If the story focuses on a childcare center closing, lead with: "Another one. And the workers were probably making $14/hr." If it's about parents leaving the workforce, emphasize the Quebec workforce participation data. If CCCAP is mentioned, note the coverage gaps specifically.

### Spear 9: Immigration Enforcement
**Deploy when:** Any story about ICE raids, immigration enforcement, deportation, sanctuary city policy, or immigrant community fear
**Policy connection:** Full Sanctuary City (`immigration-sanctuary.md`)
**Target outlets:** Denverite, Denver Post, Univision Denver, Telemundo Denver, CBS Colorado

**The comment:**
> Denver's Latino community is over 30% of the city population (Census ACS, 2023). These are our neighbors, our coworkers, our kids' classmates. The Supreme Court confirmed in Printz v. United States (1997) that cities cannot be forced to enforce federal immigration law — Denver has zero obligation to do ICE's job. And yet Flock camera data from Denver was searched over 1,400 times by ICE since June 2024, despite repeated assurances from the administration that no data was shared with immigration enforcement. SB26-005, currently moving through the state legislature, would create state court remedies for rights violations during immigration enforcement. Getting people working, with IDs and legal support, reduces costs faster than enforcement cooperation ever could.

**Customization notes:** If the story mentions a specific raid or enforcement action near a school, hospital, or courthouse, reference those as locations that should be protected zones. If Flock cameras are mentioned, connect directly to the 1,400 ICE searches. If the story discusses the $100M+ in migrant spending, note: "The cost driver was federal policy failure — lack of work authorization and zero federal reimbursement — not sanctuary policy."

### Spear 10: Surveillance / Policing
**Deploy when:** Any story about Flock cameras, ALPR surveillance, police surveillance technology, ShotSpotter, or privacy/civil liberties concerns related to policing
**Policy connection:** Government Transparency & Digital Rights (`government-transparency.md`), Community Safety & Police Reform (`public-safety.md`)
**Target outlets:** Denverite, Denver Post, Colorado Newsline, Westword, CPR News

**The comment:**
> Here's what happened with Flock cameras in Denver: City Council voted 12-0 to reject the contract renewal. The mayor then signed a $498,509 contract — structured to fall just under the $500,000 threshold that requires council approval. That's not a coincidence, that's a deliberate end-run around democratic oversight. Audit logs obtained through CORA requests showed Denver's Flock data was searched over 1,400 times by ICE since June 2024 — in a supposed sanctuary city. DPD's 111 cameras photograph 2 million+ vehicles per month. SB26-071 is in the legislature right now to require democratic oversight of surveillance technology before it's deployed. Close to 700 people packed a town hall to protest this. The council voted unanimously against it. And it's still running.

**Customization notes:** If the story is about SB26-071 specifically, lead with the Denver Flock situation as the case study that proves why the bill is needed. If there's a new revelation about surveillance data sharing, add it. If a councilmember makes a statement, reference the 12-0 vote.

### Spear 11: Development / Gentrification
**Deploy when:** Any story about gentrification, new luxury development, neighborhood displacement, rising property values displacing residents, or corporate landlord acquisitions
**Policy connection:** The Denver Social Housing Act (`social-housing.md`), Anti-Displacement Zones (`anti-displacement.md`), Corporate Landlord Ban (`corporate-landlord-ban.md`)
**Target outlets:** Denverite, Denver Post, Westword, neighborhood publications

**The comment:**
> Here's the number that should make everyone angry: Denver spends $400,000-600,000 per unit subsidizing private developers to build "affordable" housing through LIHTC — and those affordability restrictions expire in 15-30 years, then they revert to market rate. We're spending half a million in public money per unit and getting temporary affordable housing that becomes luxury housing in 20 years. Vienna builds permanently affordable public housing and 60% of the city lives in it. They were just named the world's most livable city. Their model costs less per unit because the city owns it — no developer profit margin, no expiration date. Denver produces 500-800 affordable units a year. Thousands of existing LIHTC units are approaching expiration right now.

**Customization notes:** If the story is about a specific development, research the subsidy amount and name it. If it's about a specific neighborhood being gentrified, reference displacement data for that area. If corporate landlords are mentioned, add: "Corporate landlords are consolidating ownership across Denver, reducing competition and driving up rents."

### Spear 12: Infrastructure / Sidewalks / Transit
**Deploy when:** Any story about pedestrian safety, pedestrian deaths, sidewalk conditions, transit access, or Vision Zero failures
**Policy connection:** Pedestrian Infrastructure & Sidewalk Equity (`pedestrian-infrastructure.md`), Transportation (`transportation.md`)
**Target outlets:** Denverite, Denver Post, Denver7, 9NEWS

**The comment:**
> 43% of Denver's sidewalk network is either missing entirely or too narrow for a wheelchair — that's 1,480 miles (DOTI State of the System Report, January 2026). At previous funding levels, completing the sidewalk network would take over 400 years. That's not hyperbole — it's the math. And it's not random: low-income neighborhoods have more than double the pedestrian fatality rate of wealthier areas. 54% of high-ridership transit stops have missing sidewalks within a two-minute walk. So you take the bus because you can't afford a car, and then you walk in the street because there's no sidewalk to your stop. 93 people died on Denver streets in 2025 — the deadliest year since 2013. 35 were pedestrians. There's an interactive sidewalk data explorer at denverforall.org/tools/sidewalks where you can check conditions in your neighborhood.

**Customization notes:** If the story involves a specific pedestrian death, lead with empathy before the systemic data. Reference the specific street if it appears in the High Injury Network data (Sheridan Blvd 43% narrow, E Colfax east of Colorado Blvd 64% narrow, Leetsdale 66% narrow). If it's about transit, emphasize the 54% transit stop gap. If the Measure 307 sidewalk fee is mentioned, note: "$97.5 million in fee revenue over 3 years is a start, but the backlog is 1,480 miles."

## Deployment Notes

1. **One spear per story, max.** Dropping multiple comments on the same story looks like astroturfing.
2. **Customize before posting.** These are templates, not copy-paste. Reference the specific story, headline, or person mentioned.
3. **Engage replies.** If someone responds substantively, answer them. Ghosting after dropping a data-loaded comment undermines credibility.
4. **Only link if the engagement warrants it.** If someone asks "where can I read more?" — that's when you share the URL. Don't lead with the link.
5. **Update data points quarterly.** Minimum wage, eviction filings, PIT count, and sidewalk data all update on annual cycles. Keep the numbers current.
6. **Don't deploy on stories outside your standing.** If it's a federal story, a national politics story, or a story that has no direct connection to a Denver For All policy, skip it. The news comment strategy assessment is clear: only engage where the policy connection is direct and you have subject-matter standing.
