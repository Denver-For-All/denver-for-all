# Denver For All: Communications Strategy Review

## Executive Summary

The platform has strong bones: 25 detailed policies, consistent structure, compelling international evidence, and clear moral framing. However, a full audit reveals several categories of gaps that weaken our credibility, leave us exposed to predictable attacks, and miss opportunities to connect with Denver voters on local terms.

This review covers three areas:
1. **Critical evidence and citation gaps** (fix before any public-facing communications)
2. **Missing local context** (Denver-specific data, existing programs, political actors)
3. **Messaging improvements** (FAQ blind spots, audience-specific framing, rhetorical variety)

---

## 1. Critical Evidence Gaps

### 1.1 No Citations Anywhere

Not a single policy document includes a footnote, endnote, URL, or academic citation. Claims like "studies show" and "data shows" appear repeatedly without naming the study. This is the single biggest vulnerability across the entire platform. Any journalist, opponent, or fact-checker will flag it immediately.

**Fix:** Every factual claim needs at minimum a source name and year. Ideally, add a references section at the bottom of each policy with links. Priority claims to cite:

| Policy | Claim | Likely Source |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| Social Housing | "7,500 people experiencing homelessness" | Metro Denver PIT Count (year?) |
| Rent Control | "Denver rents increased 95%+ since 2010" | Zillow ZORI, ApartmentList, or Census ACS |
| Tenant Rights | "90%+ of landlords have attorneys, <10% of tenants do" | NYC Right to Counsel evaluation or NLADA |
| Corporate Landlord Ban | "Evict at 2-3x the rate of individual landlords" | ACCE Institute or Private Equity Stakeholder Project report |
| Living Wage | MIT Living Wage Calculator figures | livingwage.mit.edu (need date stamp; updates annually) |
| Drug Policy | "Zero deaths in supervised consumption sites worldwide" | Potier et al. systematic review or EMCDDA data |
| Healthcare | "Medical debt is leading cause of bankruptcy" | Himmelstein et al. (note: 2019 NEJM study challenged this) |
| Climate | "Elevated radioactive isotopes near Rocky Flats" | Name the independent study and who conducted it |

### 1.2 Statistics Without Year Stamps

Multiple statistics will age quickly without dates. Denver's minimum wage, rent medians, police budget, city budget total, and international comparison figures all change annually. Each needs a "(2024)" or "(2025)" tag at minimum.

### 1.3 Overstated Calculations

The Housing First page estimates "$270M-465M/year in savings" by multiplying per-person savings by the full 7,500 homeless population. But not all 7,500 people cost $55K-95K in the current model. Many are not chronically homeless and do not cycle through emergency services at that rate. This calculation is likely overstated and will be challenged. Recalculate using the chronically homeless subset or provide the methodology transparently.

## 2. Missing Local Denver Context

### 2.1 Existing Programs Not Mentioned

Several policies propose things Denver already partially does without acknowledging the existing program. This makes us look uninformed or duplicative:

| Policy | Existing Denver/Colorado Program We Don't Mention |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Community Land Trusts | **Elevation Community Land Trust** (Denver's existing CLT) |
| Paid Leave | **Colorado FAMLI** (12 weeks paid leave, took effect 2024) |
| Municipal Broadband | **Denver Measure 2J (2018)**: voters already approved municipal broadband. Why hasn't it been built? |
| Drug Policy | **Denver Proposition 301 (2019)** psilocybin decriminalization + **Colorado Prop 122 (2022)** |
| Public Safety | **Office of the Independent Monitor** (existing civilian oversight) |
| Education | **Colorado Universal Pre-K** (CDEC, Proposition EE) |
| Childcare | **Colorado Child Care Assistance Program (CCCAP)** |
| Climate | **Denver 80x50 Climate Action Plan**, Xcel Energy timeline |

**Fix:** Each policy should have a "What Denver Currently Does" section that names the existing program, states its scale and limitations, and explains how our proposal goes further. This is essential framing. It shows we are building on what exists rather than ignoring it.

The municipal broadband gap is especially striking. Denver voters already approved this in 2018. The story should be: "Why hasn't Denver built what voters demanded?" That is a much more powerful argument than proposing it as new.

### 2.2 No Denver Politicians Named

Across 25 policies, not a single sitting councilmember, the mayor, or any specific Denver political figure is named. This makes the "why hasn't Denver done this?" framing entirely abstract. The campaign finance tool exists on the site but the policies themselves do not connect the dots.

**Fix (selective, factual, defensible):**
- Name specific developer subsidies Denver has approved with per-unit costs
- Reference specific council votes on housing, police budget, surveillance contracts
- Reference the mayor's specific policy positions and actions where they conflict with our platform
- Connect campaign contributions to voting patterns (our Follow the Money tool should feed into policy narratives)

### 2.3 No Stakeholder / Opposition Analysis

None of the 25 policies identify who in Denver would oppose the proposal, what lobbying groups are active, or what arguments they will use. This leaves us reactive rather than proactive.

**Fix:** Each policy should identify:
- Primary opposition stakeholders (Denver Metro Association of Realtors, Colorado Restaurant Association, Denver Police Protective Association, specific corporate landlords, etc.)
- Their likely arguments
- Our preemptive response
- Their campaign contribution patterns (tie to Follow the Money tool)

### 2.4 Legal Feasibility Gaps

Several proposals face legal challenges under Colorado or federal law that are either not mentioned or hand-waved:

| Policy | Legal Issue Not Addressed |
|--------|--------------------------|
| Vacancy Tax | **TABOR**: any new Denver tax requires voter approval |
| Rent Control | **CRS 38-12-301**: Colorado state preemption of rent control (name the statute) |
| Corporate Landlord Ban | **Takings clause** (5th/14th Amendment) implications of mandatory divestiture |
| Works Councils | **NLRA federal preemption** of city-level labor relations law |
| 32-Hour Work Week | **FLSA**: can cities actually set lower overtime thresholds? Which have done so? |
| Sectoral Bargaining | **NLRA preemption**: the FAQ should address this head-on |

---

## 3. FAQ Blind Spots: Missing Counter-Arguments

Each policy has 2-4 FAQ items, but several miss the single most predictable objection. An opponent or skeptical voter will immediately ask these questions, and silence reads as evasion:

| Policy | Missing FAQ |
|--------|------------|
| Social Housing | "Where will 10,000 units go? What about NIMBYism?" |
| Rent Control | "What about small landlords with mortgages who can't survive a 3% cap?" |
| Vacancy Tax | "Is this legal under TABOR?" |
| Corporate Landlord Ban | "Won't forced divestiture cause a fire sale that crashes home prices?" |
| Drug Policy | **"What about Oregon?"** (Measure 110 partial reversal in 2024 is the #1 attack vector) |
| Immigration | **"What about Denver's $100M+ migrant spending in 2023-2024?"** |
| Paid Leave | "Doesn't Colorado's FAMLI already cover this?" |
| Public Safety | "What about Denver's current crime trends?" (If crime is rising, this is the first thing opponents say) |
| Living Wage | "What about border effects with Aurora, Lakewood, and other surrounding cities?" |
| Participatory Budgeting | "What prevents wealthy neighborhoods from dominating the process?" |
| Education | "Doesn't Colorado already have Universal Pre-K?" |
| Municipal Broadband | "Voters approved this in 2018. What happened?" (Turn this into offense) |

## 4. Messaging Improvements

### 4.1 Template Fatigue

All 25 policies follow an identical structure: Problem, Solution, International Evidence table, How We Pay, FAQ. This consistency has value but creates a template feel that undermines authenticity. Consider:
- Varying the order for some policies
- Leading with a Denver resident story for 3-4 policies
- Using a "What Denver Currently Does vs. What We Propose" comparison format for policies where existing programs exist
- Adding a "What Happened When Other Cities Did This" narrative section (not just a table) for 2-3 flagship policies

### 4.2 Tone Calibration for Different Audiences

The current tone is consistent across all policies: morally clear, data-forward, somewhat academic. This works well for policy-literate progressives but may not connect with:
- **Moderate swing voters** who need reassurance about feasibility and cost
- **Working-class voters** who respond to concrete dollar amounts ("This saves you $X/month") rather than international comparisons
- **Small business owners** who need to hear that these policies will not destroy their livelihoods

Consider developing 2-3 audience-specific message frames for flagship policies (housing, wages, healthcare).

### 4.3 Contrast Messaging

The platform currently runs entirely on positive vision. There is zero contrast messaging with incumbent politicians, developers, or corporate actors. For a political campaign, this is a gap. Voters need to understand not just what we would do, but why the current approach has failed and who is responsible.

Key contrast frames:
- **Housing:** "Denver spent $X per unit subsidizing private developers. Vienna builds public housing for $Y per unit. Where did your money go?"
- **Surveillance:** "The city signed a contract with Flock Safety for mass surveillance cameras without a public vote or council debate. We believe public safety decisions belong to the public."
- **Democracy:** "When was the last time anyone asked you how your tax dollars should be spent? In Paris, residents vote on 500M euros of spending. In Denver, you get a public comment period and a rubber stamp."
- **Corporate influence:** "Follow the money. When the same developers who receive city subsidies are donating to the campaigns of the people approving those subsidies, that is not public service. That is a transaction."

### 4.4 Bilingual Content Parity

The i18n files contain translations for navigation and UI elements, but the 25 policy documents themselves are English-only with Spanish title/summary fields. For 30%+ of Denver's population, the full policy substance is inaccessible. Priority: translate at minimum the 5 flagship policies (Social Housing, Rent Control, Living Wage, Healthcare, Immigration/Sanctuary) in full.
