## The Problem

Denver's current "affordable housing" is temporary. Tax credit projects expire after 15-30 years and revert to market rate. Down payment assistance doesn't prevent future displacement when neighborhoods gentrify and taxes rise. The affordable housing we build today disappears tomorrow.

We need permanently affordable housing controlled by the community, not by developers or the market.

## Our Solution

### Denver Community Land Trust Initiative

**City-seeded CLTs:** Denver funds 5 Community Land Trusts — one for each geographic region of the city — with $10M each in startup capital ($50M total).

**How CLTs work:**
1. The CLT owns the land. Permanently.
2. Homeowners buy (or rent) the building on the land.
3. When they sell, resale prices are limited by formula — typically allowing the owner to recoup their investment + equity from improvements + a modest appreciation share (e.g., 25% of market appreciation).
4. The next buyer gets the home at an affordable price. Forever.

**Governance:** Each CLT is governed by a tripartite board:
- 1/3 CLT residents
- 1/3 community members (non-resident neighbors)
- 1/3 public representatives (city appointees with housing expertise)

**Acquisition strategy:**
- Right of first purchase when properties in anti-displacement zones are listed for sale
- Acquire properties from corporate landlord divestiture (see: Corporate Landlord Ban)
- Partner with Social Housing Authority for multi-family buildings
- Accept donated properties with tax benefits for donors

**Target:** 2,500 permanently affordable homes within CLTs over 10 years.

## How We Pay For It

- **Startup capital:** $50M from city bonds, federal HOME program funds, and vacancy tax revenue
- **Ongoing:** CLTs are self-sustaining once established — ground lease fees cover operations
- **Acquisition:** Funded by vacancy tax revenue, corporate landlord divestiture proceeds, and federal grants

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Do CLTs actually work?"**
Champlain Housing Trust in Burlington, VT has operated since 1984 with over 2,800 homes. Foreclosure rates are 10x lower than conventional mortgages. Homes stay affordable across generations. It works.

**"Is this really homeownership if you can't keep all the profit?"**
You own your home. You build equity. You just can't speculate on the land underneath it. The trade-off: you paid an affordable price going in. The next family deserves the same opportunity. This is homeownership for people who want homes, not for people who want investment vehicles.
