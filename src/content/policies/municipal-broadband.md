## The Problem

Denver residents pay $80-120/month for internet that is slower, less reliable, and more expensive than what residents of cities with municipal broadband receive. Comcast and CenturyLink operate as a de facto duopoly, providing:
- Inconsistent speeds that rarely match advertised rates
- Data caps designed to extract additional fees
- Poor customer service (Comcast is consistently rated the most-hated company in America)
- Lobbying against any competition, including municipal broadband
- Redlining: underinvestment in low-income and minority neighborhoods

Internet access is essential infrastructure - required for school, work, healthcare, and civic participation. Treating it as a luxury product controlled by monopolies is a policy failure.

### What Denver Currently Does (And What Voters Already Approved)

**In 2018, Denver voters passed Ballot Measure 2J with 85% support, authorizing the city to provide municipal broadband.** That was seven years ago. Denver has not built a municipal broadband network.

Colorado previously had SB 05-152, which restricted municipalities from offering broadband services. Cities had to hold a ballot measure to opt out. Denver voters did exactly that, overwhelmingly. Since then, the city has conducted feasibility studies and small pilot programs but has not committed to a citywide fiber buildout.

Meanwhile, Longmont (30 miles north) built NextLight, which offers gigabit for $50/month, achieved profitability within 5 years, and has 90%+ customer satisfaction (NextLight Annual Report, 2023). Fort Collins built Connexion despite a $150M Comcast-funded opposition campaign, and is on track for profitability.

**Denver voters said yes. The mandate exists. The question is why city hall has not acted on it.**

### Who Opposes This (and Why)

Comcast and CenturyLink/Lumen are the primary opponents. They spent $150M trying to defeat Fort Collins' broadband ballot measure and have lobbied heavily at the state level against municipal broadband. The telecom industry donates to Denver city council candidates and to state legislators. Follow the money: trace campaign contributions from telecom PACs to the officials who have delayed implementation of Measure 2J.

## Our Solution

### Denver Fiber - City-Owned Broadband

**Infrastructure:**
- City-owned fiber optic network reaching every address in Denver
- Symmetrical gigabit speeds (1 Gbps up and down) for all tiers
- No data caps. No throttling. No hidden fees.

**Pricing:**

| Tier | Speed | Price |
|------|-------|-------|
| Basic | 100 Mbps | $15/month |
| Standard | 500 Mbps | $25/month |
| Gigabit | 1 Gbps | $30/month |
| Low-income | 100 Mbps | Free (income-qualified) |

Compare to Comcast: $80-120/month for comparable speeds with data caps and annual price increases.

**Key features:**
- **Net neutrality guaranteed** - no content blocking, throttling, or paid prioritization. Written into the charter.
- **No data caps.** Ever.
- **Privacy by default.** Denver Fiber does not sell, share, or monetize customer browsing data.
- **Free tier** for households at or below 200% federal poverty level
- **Digital literacy programs** at libraries and community centers
- **Free public WiFi** in all parks, community centers, and transit stations

**Rollout plan:**
- Year 1-2: Backbone infrastructure and first neighborhoods (prioritize underserved areas)
- Year 3-4: Expand to 50% of Denver addresses
- Year 5-7: Complete citywide buildout
- Revenue from early subscribers funds continued expansion

### International Evidence: Public Internet Is Normal

| Country/City | Model | Speed | Price | Result |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| **South Korea** | Government-led broadband infrastructure investment. | 1 Gbps+ standard | ~$30/month | Fastest internet in the world. 98% penetration. |
| **Romania** | Small local ISPs built fiber with minimal regulation. | 1 Gbps standard | ~$10/month | Faster and cheaper than US broadband at 1/4 the GDP per capita. Proof that competition drives prices down. |
| **Finland** | Legal right to broadband access (2010). Government investment in underserved areas. | 100 Mbps minimum guaranteed | Varies | Broadband declared a legal right. Universal access regardless of location or income. |
| **Chattanooga, TN** | City-owned EPB Fiber. First gigabit in Western Hemisphere (2010). | 10 Gbps available | $68/month gig | Profitable. Attracts tech businesses. Economic development engine. |
| **Longmont, CO** | NextLight municipal broadband. 30 miles from Denver. | 1 Gbps | $50/month | Profitable within 5 years. 90%+ customer satisfaction. Proof of concept in Denver's backyard. |
| **Fort Collins, CO** | Connexion municipal broadband. | 1 Gbps | $60/month | On track for profitability. Residents voted 57% in favor despite $150M Comcast-funded opposition campaign. |

**The US pays more for worse internet than most of the developed world** because we let monopolies control infrastructure. Municipal broadband breaks the monopoly, and the evidence from cities that have done it consistently shows better speeds, lower prices, and community benefit (Institute for Local Self-Reliance, Community Broadband Networks database, 2025).

## How We Pay For It

**Capital cost:** $300-500M for citywide fiber buildout (based on comparable city deployments)

**Financing:** Revenue bonds backed by subscriber fees. Municipal broadband networks in Chattanooga, Longmont (CO), and Fort Collins (CO) are all financially self-sustaining.

**Longmont, Colorado** (30 miles north of Denver) did exactly this. NextLight municipal broadband: gigabit for $50/month, profitable within 5 years, beloved by residents. If Longmont can do it, Denver can do it.

**Net cost to taxpayers:** Negative within 5-7 years. Subscriber revenue exceeds debt service and operating costs.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Government can't run an ISP."**
Longmont, CO does. Chattanooga, TN does. Over 900 communities in the US have municipal broadband. They consistently outperform private ISPs in speed, reliability, price, and customer satisfaction.

**"This is unfair competition with private companies."**
Comcast and CenturyLink have had decades to provide good, affordable service. They chose monopoly profits instead. If they can't compete with a city-run network, that's their failure, not ours.

**"Won't this cost too much?"**
Longmont's fiber network was profitable within 5 years. Fort Collins is on track for the same. The infrastructure pays for itself through subscriber fees. This is an investment, not an expense.

**"Didn't Denver voters already approve this? What happened?"**
Yes. In 2018, 85% of Denver voters approved Ballot Measure 2J authorizing municipal broadband. The city has conducted feasibility studies but not committed to a buildout. We intend to hold the city to the mandate voters already gave it.
