## Comment 1: Housing Supply vs. Lisa's Resistance to Building

**Context:** Thread about Denver's housing crisis, someone complaining Lisa doesn't want to build

> The thing that kills me about Lisa's position is that she acts like building housing and protecting existing residents are mutually exclusive. They're not. You can build AND stabilize rents. You can add supply AND prevent displacement. Vienna builds 10,000+ public units and caps rent increases, and their city works fine. Meanwhile Lisa doesn't want to build and doesn't want rent protections either, so we just get... nothing? The status quo is people getting priced out with zero options. We need candidates who actually have a housing plan that does both -- build publicly owned affordable housing AND protect the people who already live here.

## Comment 2: Flock Surveillance vs. Democratic Accountability

**Context:** Thread about Mike Johnston and the Flock Safety camera deal

> This is the part that genuinely bothers me about Mike. You can debate whether surveillance cameras reduce crime (the data is mixed at best). But the fact that he pushed through a mass surveillance contract with Flock without a real public process? That's the issue. Denver voters weren't consulted. Council barely had time to review it. And now we have automated license plate readers across the city feeding data to a private company. If you're confident this is good policy, put it to a vote. Let people weigh in. The fact that he didn't tells you everything. Denver needs leaders who trust residents enough to actually let them make decisions -- participatory budgeting, citizens' assemblies, real democratic input. Not backroom deals with surveillance vendors.

## Comment 3: Housing Costs and Developer Subsidies vs. Both

**Context:** Thread comparing Lisa and Mike, general frustration with housing affordability

> Neither of them are serious about housing costs. Denver spends $400-600K per unit subsidizing private developers to build "affordable" housing that stops being affordable the second the tax credit period expires. Vienna builds permanently affordable public housing for a fraction of that. Lisa doesn't want to build. Mike builds, but it's sweetheart deals for developers funded with public money that could go way further if the city just built and owned the housing itself. Meanwhile rents have nearly doubled since 2010 and we have zero rent stabilization protections. Every other major city in the developed world has some form of rent regulation. Denver has nothing. There are actual policy frameworks that work -- social housing, community land trusts, rent stabilization tied to CPI. Other cities and countries have done this. We just choose not to.

## Comment 4: Mike's Approach to Homelessness vs. Housing First

**Context:** Thread about encampment sweeps, homelessness policy

> Mike's sweep-and-shelter approach costs more and accomplishes less than just housing people. This isn't theory -- Finland cut their homeless population by 80% with Housing First. Houston housed 25,000+ people. The data consistently shows that permanent supportive housing costs $15-25K per person per year while the shelter/ER/jail cycle costs $55-95K. We're literally spending more money to get worse outcomes because "just give people housing" sounds too simple. Meanwhile Mike keeps sweeping encampments, which doesn't reduce homelessness -- it just moves it. And it destroys people's belongings and medical supplies in the process. At some point you have to ask whether the goal is actually solving homelessness or just making it less visible for downtown business owners.

## Comment 5: Municipal Broadband -- Voters Already Said Yes

**Context:** Thread about internet costs, Comcast complaints, or general Denver politics

> Here's one that really shows you how Denver politics works. In 2018, Denver voters passed a ballot measure authorizing the city to build a municipal broadband network. Voters said yes. And then... nothing happened. Meanwhile Longmont built NextLight, charges $50/month for gigabit, and it's been profitable for years. Fort Collins did it too. Chattanooga did it and got 10 Gbps speeds. Denver residents are still paying Comcast $80-120/month for worse service because the city never followed through on what voters already approved. That's the pattern -- whether it's Mike or whoever comes next. They ask for your vote, get it, then serve the interests of whoever is writing the campaign checks. We need actual accountability mechanisms like participatory budgeting where residents directly decide how public money gets spent.

## Comment 6: Workers and Wages vs. Corporate Ties

**Context:** Thread about cost of living, wages, or labor issues in Denver

> MIT's Living Wage Calculator says a family of four in Denver needs about $25-26/hr just to survive. Denver's minimum wage is around $18. That's a $7/hr gap between what people earn and what they need. And look at who's blocking progress -- the same politicians taking donations from the restaurant lobby and corporate employers who benefit from keeping wages low. There are seven states that already eliminated the tipped minimum wage entirely and their restaurant industries are fine. Denmark pays fast food workers $22/hr and a Big Mac costs like 80 cents more. We act like paying people enough to live on is radical when most of the developed world already does it. Neither Lisa nor Mike has proposed anything close to closing that gap.
