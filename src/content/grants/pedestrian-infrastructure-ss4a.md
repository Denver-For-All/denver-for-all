## Project Narrative

### A. Project Description

**Project Title:** Denver Sidewalk Equity & ADA Compliance Acceleration Project

**Applicant:** City and County of Denver, Department of Transportation & Infrastructure (DOTI)

**Requested Amount:** $15,000,000

**Project Duration:** 36 months

**Project Summary:** The City and County of Denver requests $15 million in Safe Streets for All Implementation Grant funding to accelerate sidewalk construction and ADA compliance upgrades in the city's highest-need neighborhoods. Denver has 3,110 miles of sidewalks; 40% (1,235 miles) are deficient and fail ADA standards, and 11% (358 miles) are completely missing. Low-income neighborhoods have more than double the pedestrian fatality rate of wealthier communities. In 2025, 35 pedestrians were killed on Denver streets — a 34% increase over 2024. This project targets the 15 neighborhoods with the highest pedestrian fatality rates and lowest sidewalk coverage for priority construction, ADA retrofits, and traffic calming measures along school and transit corridors.

### B. Location & Context

**Project Area:** City and County of Denver, Colorado (population ~715,000)

**Priority Neighborhoods (ranked by pedestrian fatality rate and sidewalk deficiency):**
- East Colfax
- Montbello
- Elyria-Swansea
- Globeville
- Sun Valley
- Northeast Park Hill
- Westwood
- Valverde
- West Colfax
- Lincoln Park
- Ruby Hill
- Barnum / Barnum West
- Harvey Park / Harvey Park South
- Villa Park
- College View / South Platte

**Urbanized Area:** Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area

**Disadvantaged Community Status:** 12 of 15 target neighborhoods qualify as disadvantaged communities under the Justice40 initiative, based on Census tract-level poverty rates, minority population percentages, and infrastructure investment gaps.

### C. Safety Problem Identification

Denver's comprehensive safety data demonstrates a critical and worsening pedestrian safety crisis:

**Fatal and Serious Injury Data:**
- 93 traffic deaths in 2025 (deadliest year since 2013)
- 35 pedestrian fatalities in 2025 (34% increase over 2024)
- Pedestrians represent ~5% of commuters but ~33% of traffic deaths
- Pedestrians are approximately 30x more likely to die than vehicle occupants
- Low-income neighborhoods experience 2x the pedestrian fatality rate of higher-income areas

**Infrastructure Deficiency Data (DOTI Sidewalk Implementation Plan, 2025):**
- 1,235 miles of sidewalk (40%) are less than 5 feet wide and fail ADA standards
- 358 miles of sidewalk (11%) are completely missing
- Denver Auditor (2020): sidewalk program was "decades behind schedule and was not designed for ADA compliance"
- At prior funding levels, completing the sidewalk network would take over 400 years

**Existing Safety Plan:** Denver adopted Vision Zero in 2017 with a goal of zero traffic deaths by 2030. The city's current trajectory is moving away from this goal, not toward it.

### D. Project Activities & Deliverables

**Activity 1: Priority Sidewalk Construction ($8,000,000)**
- Construct missing sidewalks on approximately 25-35 miles of priority corridors in the 15 target neighborhoods
- Focus on routes to schools, transit stops, healthcare facilities, and grocery stores
- All construction to minimum 6-foot width (exceeding ADA 5-foot minimum) to allow wheelchair passing
- Install detectable warning surfaces at all intersections
- Include tree lawns or physical buffer zones separating sidewalks from vehicle traffic

**Activity 2: ADA Compliance Retrofits ($4,000,000)**
- Retrofit approximately 500 curb ramps to ADA compliance standards
- Widen existing sub-standard sidewalks to 5-foot minimum on approximately 15-20 miles of arterial corridors
- Install tactile paving and accessible pedestrian signals at priority intersections
- Conduct post-construction ADA compliance audits by certified inspectors

**Activity 3: Traffic Calming & Pedestrian Safety ($2,000,000)**
- Install pedestrian refuge islands, raised crosswalks, and curb extensions at high-crash intersections within target neighborhoods
- Add pedestrian-scale lighting on priority school and transit corridors
- Implement leading pedestrian intervals at signalized intersections

**Activity 4: Project Management, Community Engagement & Evaluation ($1,000,000)**
- Dedicated project manager and grant compliance staff
- Community engagement in each target neighborhood (minimum 3 public meetings per neighborhood)
- Pre/post pedestrian count data collection
- Crash reduction analysis at 12, 24, and 36 months
- Final evaluation report with methodology for replication

### E. Project Timeline

| Phase | Timeline | Key Milestones |
|---|---|---|
| **Planning & Design** | Months 1-6 | Finalize priority corridors, complete engineering design, execute community engagement round 1 |
| **Procurement** | Months 4-8 | Issue RFPs, award construction contracts (can overlap with design for phased corridors) |
| **Construction Phase 1** | Months 7-18 | Complete school route and transit corridor sidewalks in 8 highest-priority neighborhoods |
| **Construction Phase 2** | Months 15-30 | Complete remaining corridors, ADA retrofits, and traffic calming installations |
| **Closeout & Evaluation** | Months 28-36 | Post-construction audits, pedestrian count data, crash analysis, final report |

### F. Alignment with SS4A Program Goals

This project directly advances the Safe Streets for All program goals:

1. **Develops or carries out a comprehensive safety action plan:** Builds on Denver's Vision Zero Action Plan and DOTI Sidewalk Implementation Plan (2025)
2. **Addresses an identified safety need through infrastructure investment:** Targets the specific neighborhoods and corridors with the highest documented pedestrian fatality rates
3. **Incorporates equity:** 12 of 15 target neighborhoods are Justice40-qualifying disadvantaged communities; progressive prioritization ensures the most dangerous areas are served first
4. **Integrates Safe System approach:** Addresses roadway design (sidewalks, buffer zones), speed management (traffic calming), and post-crash care (reduced response times via improved access)

### G. Demonstrated Local Commitment

Denver has made substantial local investment in pedestrian infrastructure:

- **Measure 307 (2022):** Voters approved transferring sidewalk responsibility from property owners to the city, funded by a $150/year fee
- **$97.5 million** in expected sidewalk fee revenue over the first 3 years
- **$75 million** in sidewalk construction contracts awarded in 2025
- **Vision Zero Plan** adopted 2017 with dedicated staff and dashboard
- **Denver Streets Partnership** coalition providing community advocacy and data

The requested federal investment of $15 million represents a **6.4:1 local match ratio** against the city's existing $97.5 million commitment — demonstrating that Denver is not seeking federal funding to replace local investment, but to accelerate a program that is already funded and underway.
