## The Problem

Denver's education system reproduces inequality instead of addressing it. Low-income neighborhoods have under-resourced schools. Teachers can't afford to live in the city where they teach. Charter school expansion has siphoned public money to private operators. And thousands of Denver children lack access to pre-K, after-school programs, and school meals.

- Denver teachers' average salary: ~$58K. Denver median rent requires ~$55K just for housing. Teachers are leaving.
- DPS has pushed aggressive charter expansion, diverting per-pupil funding from traditional public schools
- After-school programs are concentrated in wealthy neighborhoods
- Food insecurity affects 1 in 4 Denver children

## Our Solution

### 1. Universal Pre-K (City-Funded)
- Free, full-day pre-K for every Denver 3- and 4-year-old
- No income qualification — universal access
- Located in public schools and community centers
- Living wage for pre-K teachers (at parity with K-12)
- Curriculum: play-based, developmentally appropriate, bilingual options

### 2. Free School Meals for All
- Universal free breakfast and lunch for all DPS students, regardless of family income
- Eliminates stigma of "free lunch" identification
- Sourced from local farms when possible
- Summer meal programs at all community centers

### 3. After-School Programs in Every Neighborhood
- City-funded after-school programs at every DPS elementary and middle school
- Arts, sports, tutoring, coding, music — not just test prep
- Free for all students, operating until 6 PM
- Staffed by trained youth workers at living wages

### 4. Teacher Housing Assistance
- Dedicated affordable housing units for DPS teachers (via Social Housing Authority)
- Down payment assistance for teachers buying in Denver
- Housing stipend for teachers in high-need schools
- Goal: every teacher who works in Denver can afford to live in Denver

### 5. Anti-Privatization
- Moratorium on new charter school approvals until DPS facilities are fully funded
- Require charter schools to accept all students (including special education and English Language Learners) at the same rate as district schools
- Full financial transparency for all charter operators
- Close charters that underperform comparable district schools
- Redirect charter management fees to classroom investment

### 6. Community Schools Model
- Convert 20 high-need schools to full-service community schools
- Wrap-around services on-site: health clinic, food pantry, parent education, legal aid, social workers
- Schools as community hubs, not just test-taking factories

## How We Pay For It

- Universal Pre-K: $40-50M/year (city bonds + federal Pre-K funds)
- Free meals: $15-20M/year (partially offset by federal reimbursement)
- After-school: $20-25M/year
- Teacher housing: Integrated into Social Housing Authority budget
- Community schools: $10-15M/year (with federal Community Schools grants)
- Total: $85-110M/year — significant, but Denver's budget is $1.6B+

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Isn't education a state/district issue, not a city issue?"**
Denver is a consolidated city-county, and DPS operates within it. The city can fund pre-K, after-school, and community schools independently of DPS. The city also controls housing, which directly affects teacher retention.

**"Charter schools give parents choice."**
Choice without equity is just sorting. When charter schools can reject difficult students and traditional public schools cannot, the comparison is rigged. Fund all schools equally first, then talk about choice.
