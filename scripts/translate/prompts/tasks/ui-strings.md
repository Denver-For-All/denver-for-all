Translate the following JSON file of UI strings for the Denver For All civic platform. This contains navigation labels, headings, button text, form placeholders, and other interface strings.

Return a valid JSON object with the EXACT SAME structure and keys, but with translated values. Do not translate JSON keys — only translate the string values.

Special handling:
- The "nav.language" key should contain the name of ENGLISH in the target language (e.g., "English" for all non-English locales) since this is the label for switching back to English
- Translate "your@email.com" to an equivalent localized placeholder (e.g., Vietnamese: "email@cuaban.com", Chinese: "your@email.com", Arabic: "your@email.com", Amharic: "your@email.com") — keep the email format recognizable

Output ONLY the JSON — no markdown code fences, no explanation.
