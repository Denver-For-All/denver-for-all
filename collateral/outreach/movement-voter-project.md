## Partner Application Letter

**Subject:** Partner Application — Denver For All (Denver, CO)

Dear Movement Voter Project team,

I'm applying for partner status on behalf of Denver For All (denverforall.org), a grassroots civic organization building power for working people in Denver, Colorado through evidence-based policy research, free civic tools, and community organizing.

### Why Denver Matters in 2026–2027

Denver's 2027 municipal election is a pivotal opportunity:
- **All 13 council seats** and the mayor's office are on the ballot
- **Outside spending** in Denver elections increased 380% from 2019–2023, driven primarily by real estate PACs
- **Key state preemptions** (rent control banned since 1981) make local organizing essential for building power toward state-level change
- **Colorado's federal delegation** is a critical hold for progressive priorities

### What We've Built

On under $840/year, Denver For All has created:

- **47 evidence-based policy proposals** grounded in academic research, international evidence, and Denver-specific data
- **8 free civic tools:** eviction tracker, rent calculator, campaign finance tracker, bilingual tenant rights chatbot, candidate accountability trackers, sidewalk data explorer
- **6 federal grant templates** ready for city staff to file
- **Legislative analysis** with 10 proposals ready for immediate city council introduction
- **Organizing playbook** with targeted outreach strategies for Denver's diverse communities
- **Bilingual platform** serving Denver's 30% Hispanic/Latino population

We currently reach ~600 unique visitors per week and are growing through grassroots outreach.

### Our Theory of Change

1. **Research builds credibility** — Evidence-based proposals give council members, advocates, and media the substance they need to act
2. **Tools build power** — Free civic tools (eviction data, campaign finance transparency, candidate accountability) shift information asymmetry from institutions to residents
3. **Organizing builds movements** — Grassroots outreach, Resistbot campaigns, and community engagement translate research into political pressure
4. **Elections build governance** — Candidate accountability trackers and nonpartisan voter education ensure the 2027 election produces a council that acts

### What Partnership Would Enable

- Scale our organizing capacity for the 2027 municipal election
- Fund expanded community outreach, especially in high-displacement neighborhoods and Spanish-language communities
- Deploy candidate accountability tools across all 13 council districts
- Support introduction of Tier 1 policy proposals to city council
- Build grassroots base for 2027 ballot measures (vacancy tax, social housing bonds)

### Impact Metrics

| Metric | Current | With MVP Support |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| Weekly unique visitors | 600 | 3,000+ |
| Council districts with candidate coverage | 2/13 | 13/13 |
| Resistbot petition campaigns | 5 | 20+ |
| Bilingual policy pages | Partial | Complete |
| Community events/forums | 0 | 12+/year |
| Tier 1 proposals introduced to council | 0 | 5+ |

### Values Alignment

- **Grassroots-funded:** No corporate money, ever
- **Community-led:** Built by tenants, workers, and neighbors — not consultants
- **Racially equitable:** Bilingual platform centering communities most impacted by displacement
- **Open source:** All research, tools, and code publicly available for replication

We would welcome a conversation about how Denver For All fits within MVP's portfolio.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
Denver For All
