## The Problem

A single hospital stay in Denver can produce a bill exceeding $1 million. Medical debt is the leading cause of bankruptcy in America. Denver Health, a public hospital, still sends patients to collections and places liens on homes. The system generates debt, not health.

Meanwhile:
- Denver has insufficient mental health crisis services — police respond to mental health emergencies they're not trained for, with predictable results
- Entire neighborhoods lack accessible primary care
- Prescription drugs cost 2-10x what they cost in other countries
- Uninsured and underinsured residents delay care until emergencies, which costs everyone more

## Our Solution

### 1. Denver Medical Debt Forgiveness Program
- City purchases medical debt portfolios at pennies on the dollar (debt buyers typically pay 1-5 cents per dollar of debt)
- Cancel all purchased debt — no strings attached
- Estimated cost: $5M in city funds can forgive $100-500M in medical debt
- Partner with RIP Medical Debt (now Undue Medical Debt) for execution
- Ongoing program funded by hospital impact fees

### 2. Hospital Cost Transparency Act
- All Denver hospitals must publish real prices (not chargemaster fiction) for the 200 most common procedures
- Itemized bills required within 30 days — no more surprise charges appearing months later
- Price variation reports published by the city quarterly
- Penalties for price gouging: defined as charging uninsured patients more than 200% of Medicare rates

### 3. STAR Program (Support Team Assisted Response)
Denver already has a nascent STAR program. We expand it dramatically:
- 24/7 coverage citywide (currently limited hours and areas)
- Mental health professionals + paramedics respond to mental health crises, substance use incidents, homelessness calls, and welfare checks
- Police are NOT dispatched for non-violent mental health calls
- Target: 75% of current "mental health" police calls redirected to STAR
- Funding: Redirect 15% of police overtime budget to STAR expansion

### 4. Community Health Centers
- Federally Qualified Health Center in every Denver neighborhood (currently significant gaps in low-income areas)
- Sliding-scale fees based on income
- Primary care, dental, vision, mental health, and substance use treatment
- Prescription drug purchasing cooperative — Denver negotiates drug prices collectively for uninsured residents

### 5. Reproductive Healthcare Protection
- Denver as a sanctuary city for reproductive healthcare access
- City-funded reproductive healthcare for uninsured residents
- Buffer zones around clinics
- Non-cooperation with states criminalizing reproductive healthcare

## How We Pay For It

- Medical Debt Program: $5M/year (forgives $100-500M)
- STAR Expansion: Redirected from police budget ($15-20M)
- Community Health Centers: Federal HRSA matching funds + city investment ($10M)
- Total city investment: ~$30-35M/year, offset by reduced emergency room utilization, reduced police costs, and improved public health outcomes

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Why should the city forgive medical debt? People chose to go to the hospital."**
People don't choose to get sick or injured. A child's cancer treatment shouldn't bankrupt a family. And the debt is sold to collectors for pennies anyway — the hospital has already written it off. This program costs the city very little and changes thousands of lives.

**"Isn't healthcare a federal issue?"**
Federal solutions aren't coming soon enough. Cities can act now — on mental health crisis response, on debt forgiveness, on community health centers, on drug pricing. We don't wait for Congress to stop our neighbors from dying.
