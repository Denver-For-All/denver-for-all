## 1. Contribution Policy (max 3,000 characters)

Denver For All accepts grassroots contributions from individuals who support economic justice in Denver. Every donation — no matter the size — is public on our Open Collective ledger.

**What we accept:**

- One-time or recurring donations from individuals
- Contributions from community organizations, mutual aid groups, unions, and cooperatives aligned with our mission
- Sponsorships from small, locally owned businesses (with public disclosure)

**What we do not accept:**

- Corporate PAC money or contributions from corporate lobbying organizations
- Donations from real estate industry lobbying groups, landlord associations, or corporate landlord entities
- Contributions from fossil fuel companies or their affiliated foundations
- Donations with conditions that influence our policy positions, editorial direction, or endorsements
- Anonymous contributions over $100 (we will reach out to confirm identity)

**How funds are used:**
Our annual operating costs are $310–840/year. Contributions go toward domain registration, AI chatbot hosting (vAPI), and any future infrastructure needs. All spending is publicly visible and every expense requires a receipt and maintainer approval. Spending decisions over $100 are discussed publicly before being submitted.

If we receive funds beyond our operating needs, excess funds will be directed toward community organizing efforts (printing, event costs, translation services) as decided through our public governance process.

We reserve the right to refund any contribution that conflicts with our values or mission.

## 2. Invoice Expenses Policy (max 16,000 characters)

**Invoice expenses** are for contracted work or services performed for Denver For All.

**When to submit an invoice:**

- You performed agreed-upon work for the project (e.g., professional translation, design work, development of a specific feature, data analysis)
- The work was discussed and approved by a maintainer BEFORE it was started
- You are not a maintainer expensing your own pre-approved work (use Reimbursement for that)

**Requirements for approval:**

- A clear description of the work performed
- The date(s) the work was completed
- The agreed-upon rate or amount (must match what was discussed before work began)
- A link to the relevant GitHub issue, pull request, or documented agreement where the work was approved
- Your name or organization name

**Approval criteria:**

- Invoices under $100: Approved by any single maintainer
- Invoices over $100: Must have been discussed publicly (GitHub issue or Open Collective conversation) before the work began, and approved by a maintainer
- All invoices are paid within 30 days of approval

**What will NOT be approved:**

- Work that was not discussed or agreed upon in advance
- Invoices without a clear description of deliverables
- Duplicate submissions for work already paid
- Amounts that differ from the pre-agreed rate without explanation

If you're unsure whether your work qualifies, open a GitHub issue or reach out to a maintainer before starting.

## 3. Reimbursement Expenses Policy (max 16,000 characters)

**Reimbursement expenses** are for out-of-pocket costs a contributor or maintainer has already paid for on behalf of Denver For All.

**Eligible expenses:**

- Domain registration and renewal
- Hosting or infrastructure costs that exceed free-tier limits (e.g., vAPI chatbot usage)
- Printing costs for community organizing materials (flyers, handouts for events)
- Event costs directly related to Denver For All organizing (venue fees, supplies)
- Translation or accessibility services
- Other costs directly related to the project's mission, as approved in advance

**Requirements for approval:**

- An itemized receipt or proof of payment (screenshot, PDF, or photo)
- A clear description of what was purchased and why
- The date of purchase
- For expenses over $100: evidence of prior public discussion (link to GitHub issue or Open Collective conversation)

**Approval criteria:**

- Reimbursements under $100: Approved by any single maintainer
- Reimbursements over $100: Must have been discussed and approved publicly before the expense was incurred
- Receipts are required for all amounts — no exceptions

**What will NOT be reimbursed:**

- Personal expenses unrelated to the project
- Purchases made without prior discussion (for amounts over $100)
- Expenses without receipts
- Travel costs (we are a volunteer-run, remote-first project)
- Food and drink (unless for a pre-approved community event)

When in doubt, ask before you spend. Open a GitHub issue or message a maintainer.

## 4. Grant Expenses Policy (max 16,000 characters)

**Grant expenses** are for larger allocations of funds toward specific project goals or community initiatives.

**Who can request a grant:**

- Contributors who want to take on a defined piece of work for the project (e.g., translating all policy documents to Spanish, building a new interactive tool, conducting original research)
- Community organizations proposing a collaboration aligned with our mission
- Individuals or groups working on Denver civic engagement projects that further our platform goals

**How to request a grant:**

1. Open a GitHub issue or Open Collective conversation describing:
   - What you plan to do
   - Why it advances Denver For All's mission
   - A budget breakdown
   - A timeline for completion
   - How you will report back on progress
2. Allow at least 7 days for community discussion
3. Maintainers will review and approve, request changes, or decline with explanation

**Approval criteria:**

- The work must directly support Denver For All's mission of economic justice and civic engagement in Denver
- The budget must be reasonable and clearly broken down
- Grants over $100 require public discussion before approval
- Grant recipients must provide a brief update or deliverable upon completion
- Funds are disbursed upon approval; for larger grants, disbursement may be split into milestones

**Grant limits:**

- Given our small operating budget ($310–840/year), grants are limited and subject to available funds
- We prioritize grants for translation, accessibility, data tools, and community organizing

**What will NOT be funded:**

- Partisan campaign contributions or candidate endorsements
- Work unrelated to Denver For All's mission
- Proposals without a clear deliverable or accountability plan
- Requests that skip the public discussion process

## 5. Expenses Title Policy (max 16,000 characters)

**General Expense Guidelines for Denver For All**

Denver For All is a volunteer-run, grassroots project with minimal operating costs. We take financial transparency seriously — every dollar in and every dollar out is publicly visible on our Open Collective page.

**Core principles:**

- All expenses must serve the project's mission of economic justice and civic engagement in Denver
- Every expense requires a receipt or documentation
- Spending over $100 must be discussed publicly before being incurred
- Any maintainer can approve expenses (but cannot approve their own)
- The community can view and comment on all expenses at any time

**Typical expenses:**

- Domain renewal (~$10–12/year)
- vAPI chatbot hosting (~$300–720/year based on usage)
- Occasional printing or event costs for community organizing
- Contracted translation, design, or development work (as needed and pre-approved)

**Expense categories:**

- **Invoice**: For contracted work or services (submit before starting — get approval first)
- **Reimbursement**: For out-of-pocket costs you've already paid (keep your receipt)
- **Grant**: For larger, defined projects (propose it publicly, allow discussion, get approval)

**Process:**

1. Before spending: Check if the expense needs public discussion (anything over $100)
2. Submit the expense on Open Collective with a clear title, description, and receipt
3. A maintainer reviews and approves or requests more information
4. Payment is processed through Open Source Collective (our fiscal host)

**Questions?** Open a GitHub issue or reach out to a maintainer. We'd rather answer a question upfront than decline an expense after the fact.
