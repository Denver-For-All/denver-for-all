## Inquiry Letter

**Subject:** Community-Initiated Solutions Grant Inquiry — Denver For All

Dear Colorado Health Foundation team,

I'm writing to inquire about grant opportunities for Denver For All (denverforall.org), a grassroots civic organization in Denver whose policy research and civic tools address health equity through housing stability, medical debt abolition, crisis response alternatives, and community safety.

### Health Equity Through Housing & Economic Justice

Denver For All approaches health as a function of housing stability, economic security, and access to care. Our research and tools address the social determinants that drive Colorado's health inequities:

**Medical Debt Forgiveness**
- 62% of US bankruptcies involve medical debt (Himmelstein et al., 2009)
- Hospital admissions reduce earnings by 20% (Dobkin et al., 2018)
- Denver Health still sends patients to collections and places liens on homes
- Our proposal: $5M city investment can forgive $100–500M in medical debt (modeled on Toledo, New Orleans, LA County programs)
- **This is a Tier 1 proposal — ready for immediate city council introduction**

**STAR Program Expansion (Mental Health Crisis Response)**
- STAR has responded to 23,000+ calls since 2022
- Urban Institute (2026): 16% reduction in arrests; 2–3x larger for homeless populations
- Community Partner Network: 1,200+ clients served, ~12,000 case management encounters
- Our proposal: Phased expansion to 24/7 citywide coverage
- **Caring for Denver Foundation is the primary STAR funder — we are applying there as well**

**Housing Stability as Health Intervention**
- 9,065 people experiencing homelessness metro Denver (MDHI, 2024)
- Housing instability is a primary driver of emergency department utilization, mental health crises, and substance use
- Our Housing First proposal documents Finland's 35% homelessness reduction
- Our eviction tracker maps displacement patterns that correlate with health disparities

**Drug Policy Reform**
- Our proposal documents treatment-first approaches reducing both substance use and incarceration
- Evidence from Portugal, international models, and domestic harm reduction programs

### Serving Communities of Color

30% of Denver's population is Hispanic/Latino. Our platform is bilingual (English/Spanish) and our research centers displacement in historically Latino neighborhoods — Globeville, Elyria-Swansea, Westwood, Montbello — where gentrification, eviction, and health disparities intersect.

Our outreach strategy prioritizes partnerships with BIPOC-led organizations including Clinica Tepeyac, Centro Humanitario, CIRC, Padres & Jóvenes Unidos, and Focus Points Family Resource Center.

### What Funding Would Support

1. **Medical debt research and campaign** ($30,000–$50,000): Deep analysis of Denver's medical debt landscape, hospital billing practices, and campaign to advocate for a city medical debt purchase program
2. **Health-housing intersection research** ($20,000–$40,000): Analysis of eviction-health outcome correlations using Denver-specific data
3. **Bilingual health policy access** ($10,000–$20,000): Professional Spanish translation of all health-related policy research
4. **Community health engagement** ($10,000–$20,000): Forums, outreach, and direct action tools focused on medical debt and STAR expansion

### Organizational Profile

Denver For All has built 47 evidence-based policy proposals, 8 free civic tools, and a comprehensive organizing infrastructure on under $840/year. We are pursuing fiscal sponsorship to accept foundation grants. We reach ~600 unique visitors per week.

I would welcome a conversation about how our work aligns with the Colorado Health Foundation's Community-Initiated Solutions program.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
Denver For All
