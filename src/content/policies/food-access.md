## The Problem

Denver has a hunger crisis hiding in plain sight. According to the Denver Department of Public Health and Environment (DDPHE), 33% of Denver's population faces food insecurity, triple the pre-pandemic rate of roughly 11% (Hunger Free Colorado, 2021). In 2024, about 15% of respondents to a city survey reported skipping meals or rationing food because they could not afford it, up from previous years. Statewide, food insecurity jumped from 8.1% in 2021 to 11.2% in 2023 after pandemic-era SNAP expansions expired (Colorado Health Institute, 2023 CHAS). Feeding America estimates that 474,420 Coloradans face hunger, including 141,570 children, with child food insecurity at 14.3%.

The geography of hunger in Denver maps directly onto race and poverty. Neighborhoods like Globeville, Elyria-Swansea, Montbello, Westwood, Sun Valley, Clayton, Northeast Park Hill, and Barnum are classified as food deserts under USDA criteria, meaning at least 500 residents or 33% of the population live more than one mile from a full-service grocery store. In Elyria-Swansea, 89% of residents do not live within a 10-minute walk of a grocery store. In Globeville, that number is 93%. In Clayton, it is 100% (Denver Human Services Index). Globeville and Elyria-Swansea have not had a single grocery store in years. Westwood went without a grocery store from the 1990s until 2020. Food deserts in Denver are disproportionately located in Black and Latino communities with high poverty rates, low car ownership, and limited public transit access.

The health consequences are severe. Residents of food deserts face elevated rates of obesity, Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and diet-related chronic illness. Children in low-income Colorado households are three times more likely to be obese than children in households earning above $75,000 (Colorado Health Institute). Meanwhile, demand at food banks is surging. Food Bank of the Rockies reported a 60% year-over-year increase in mobile food pantry visits and now spends $1.3 million per month purchasing food. Metro Caring saw nearly 5,000 visits in January 2024, almost double the same month in 2023. The proposed Kroger-Albertsons merger threatened further grocery store consolidation in vulnerable neighborhoods. This is not a personal responsibility problem. It is a structural failure.

### What Denver Currently Does

Denver has meaningful food programs, but they are underfunded and fragmented. The **Denver Sustainable Food Policy Council (SFPC)** advises the city on food-related policy, including a SNAP at Farmers Markets working group and efforts to expand food production. The **Healthy Food for Denver's Kids (HFDK)** initiative, approved by Denver voters in 2018 with 59% support, levies a 0.08% sales tax generating $12-16 million annually. Since 2020, HFDK has distributed $66.5 million to 95 organizations, serving over 31 million meals and snacks to children and families and providing 25,000 hours of nutrition education (HFDK 2023 Annual Report). **Denver Urban Gardens (DUG)** operates 200 community gardens and 24 food forests across 34 acres, engaging over 17,000 gardeners, primarily in low-income neighborhoods.

At the state level, Colorado voters approved **Proposition FF** in 2022, establishing universal free school meals for all public school students funded by limiting deductions for households earning over $300,000. The program delivered 24 million additional meals in its first year (2023-24) and saves families approximately $1,250 per child per year. Voters approved follow-up measures (Propositions LL and MM) in 2025 to shore up program funding.

These programs matter, but they do not add up to a food system. Denver still lacks a comprehensive food access strategy, dedicated funding for food desert elimination, permanent protections for community gardens, or a city food purchasing policy. As city officials have acknowledged: "We just don't have enough funding for all of those really good solutions."

## Our Solution

### 1. Eliminate Food Deserts by 2030

- **City-subsidized grocery stores** in every food desert neighborhood: tax incentives, reduced commercial rent, and low-interest loans for healthy food retailers opening in Globeville, Elyria-Swansea, Montbello, Westwood, Sun Valley, Clayton, and Northeast Park Hill
- **Healthy Corner Store Initiative**: grants of $5,000-$15,000 and technical assistance to convert existing convenience stores into sources of fresh food, including refrigeration equipment, produce display kiosks, and supplier connections. Philadelphia's Food Trust model converted 600+ stores and increased produce sales by 60%.
- **Mobile farmers markets** in every food desert neighborhood, weekly and year-round, accepting SNAP/EBT with Double Up Food Bucks matching
- **Public transportation improvements** connecting food deserts to full-service grocery stores: direct bus routes, reduced-fare passes for grocery shopping trips (cross-reference: Transportation policy)

### 2. Urban Farm & Community Garden Expansion

- **Dedicate 100+ acres of underused city land** for urban agriculture, prioritizing vacant lots in food desert neighborhoods
- **Protect existing community gardens** with permanent zoning designation. No community garden should be lost to development.
- **City-funded urban farm incubator program**: training, land access, water, seed funding, and mentorship for new urban farmers, with priority for residents of food desert neighborhoods
- **Water access for community gardens** at parks rate, not commercial rate. Water cost is the single biggest barrier to community garden sustainability.
- **Commercial urban farms** allowed in all residential zones with appropriate limits on scale, noise, and hours of operation
- **Year-round growing**: city-supported hoop houses, cold frames, and season extension infrastructure to enable 10-12 months of local food production

### 3. Free Universal School Meals

- **Free breakfast and lunch for every DPS student** regardless of income. Colorado's Proposition FF provides the foundation; the city supplements to ensure full coverage and meal quality.
- **Locally sourced food**: 30% of school meal ingredients from Colorado farms within five years, building on DPS procurement relationships and supporting the regional agricultural economy
- **Scratch-cooking kitchens in every school**: real food prepared on-site, not reheated processed meals shipped from a central facility
- **Summer meal programs** at every school site, park, and recreation center so no child goes hungry when school is out
- **After-school snack programs** at every school with an after-school program

### 4. Community Food Hubs

- **A community food hub in every food desert neighborhood**, combining: affordable grocery retail, a community kitchen, nutrition education programs, and dignified food bank distribution
- **Community kitchens**: shared commercial kitchen space for food entrepreneurs, home cooks, and community members, available at below-market rent
- **Nutrition education and cooking classes** that are culturally appropriate and multilingual, developed with community input, not imposed from outside
- **Food preservation workshops**: canning, fermenting, drying, and other methods that extend the value of fresh food and connect to cultural food traditions
- **Food bank integration**: dignified, choice-model food distribution where people select their own food rather than receiving a pre-packed box. Every person deserves agency over what they eat.

### 5. Support Local Food Economy

- **Denver food purchasing policy**: 25% of all city food procurement from local and regional farms within five years
- **Farmers market expansion**: a market in every council district, all accepting EBT/SNAP with a Double Up Food Bucks incentive that matches every SNAP dollar spent on produce
- **Food business incubator**: structured support to help food entrepreneurs start and grow businesses, from recipe development to food safety certification to retail placement
- **Commercial kitchen incubator spaces** at below-market rent in city-owned or city-supported facilities (cross-reference: Small Business & Economy policy)

### International Evidence: Food Access as Public Health

| Country/City | Model | Result |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| **Belo Horizonte, Brazil** | Declared food a right of citizenship in 1993. Created a city food agency (SUSAN) running 20 interconnected programs: subsidized restaurants serving nutritious meals for $0.50, direct farm-to-city food distribution, school meal programs. Cost: 2% of city budget. | Child mortality reduced 60% within a decade. Child hospitalization for malnutrition reduced 75%. Poverty reduced 25%. Programs reach 800,000 people daily. Became blueprint for Brazil's national Zero Hunger program. |
| **Havana, Cuba** | After Soviet collapse cut food imports, converted vacant urban lots to organoponicos (raised-bed organic farms). Labor-intensive, community-managed, no petroleum-based inputs. | Produces 90% of fresh fruits and vegetables consumed in the city. 26,000+ gardens covering 2,400+ hectares. 44,000 urban agricultural workers. 40% of households involved in food production. |
| **Detroit, USA** | Converted thousands of vacant lots in a post-industrial city to urban farms and gardens. Community-led food sovereignty movement, led by organizations like Keep Growing Detroit and the Detroit Black Community Food Sovereignty Network. | 2,200+ urban farms and gardens engaging 20,000+ residents. City appointed its first Director of Urban Agriculture in 2023. National model for community food sovereignty. |
| **Copenhagen, Denmark** | City food strategy mandating 90% organic ingredients in all public institution meals, including schools, daycare, and elder care. Achieved without increasing food budgets by investing in kitchen staff training. | Surpassed 90% organic across 900+ municipal kitchens. Over 6,000 fresh school meals prepared daily. Reduced pesticide exposure. Highest percentage of organic public food of any city in the world. |
| **South Korea** | Universal free school meals movement started in Seoul, expanded to all elementary through high school students nationwide by 2021. Funded by central and local governments. | 5.85 million students fed daily across 19,713 schools. Reduced student misbehavior by 35%. Reduced underachievement by 13%. Eliminated stigma of "free lunch kids." Saves families ~$700/child/year. |

Access to food is a human right, not a market privilege. Every international model that has treated food access as public infrastructure has seen dramatic returns: lower healthcare costs, better educational outcomes, reduced poverty, and stronger local economies. Every dollar invested in local food systems generates a multiplier effect, circulating through local farms, food businesses, and communities rather than flowing to distant corporate supply chains. Denver can join this global movement, and the economics are overwhelmingly in our favor.

## How We Pay For It

- **Food desert elimination** (grocery subsidies, corner store grants, mobile markets): $5-8M/year
- **Urban agriculture program** (land, water, incubator, infrastructure): $3-5M/year, largely self-sustaining after initial establishment as farms generate revenue
- **Universal school meals** (city supplement to state/federal programs): $15-20M/year, with significant offset from federal reimbursement and Colorado's Proposition FF funding
- **Community food hubs** (capital from city bond; operations from general fund): $5-8M/year
- **Total: $30-40M/year**, a fraction of what diet-related disease costs Denver in healthcare spending, lost productivity, and emergency room visits annually

The return on investment is clear. Diabetes alone costs Colorado an estimated $5.5 billion per year in medical expenses and lost productivity (American Diabetes Association). Preventing even a small fraction of diet-related chronic disease through improved food access pays for this entire program many times over. Prevention is always cheaper than treatment.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Why should the city provide food? That's a personal responsibility."**
Personal responsibility requires options. When your neighborhood has no grocery store for miles, when the nearest source of fresh produce requires two bus transfers, when corner stores stock chips and soda but no fruit, "personal responsibility" is meaningless. We are not proposing the city feed everyone. We are proposing the city ensure that every neighborhood has access to affordable, healthy food. That is basic infrastructure, no different from roads or water.

**"Urban farming can't feed a city."**
It does not need to. Urban agriculture supplements the food system; it does not replace industrial agriculture. But even 10-15% local food production dramatically improves access, resilience, and community health. Havana produces 90% of its fresh produce through urban farms. Detroit has 2,200 urban gardens on formerly vacant lots. Denver does not need to feed itself entirely from within city limits. It needs to ensure every neighborhood has fresh food within walking distance, and urban agriculture is one powerful tool to get there.

**"Free school meals for wealthy kids is wasteful."**
Universal programs work better than means-tested ones. When every child eats for free, there is no stigma. No child is the "free lunch kid." Participation rates go up, nutrition improves across the board, and the administrative savings from not processing income verification paperwork offset much of the cost of including higher-income families. Colorado proved this: Proposition FF delivered 24 million additional meals in its first year. South Korea's universal program reduced student misbehavior by 35% and improved academic achievement.

**"Corner stores can't sell fresh food profitably."**
They can with support. Philadelphia's Healthy Corner Store Initiative enrolled over 600 stores, provided small grants for refrigeration and display equipment, connected owners to produce suppliers, and saw produce sales increase by 60%. The infrastructure investment is modest: $5,000-$15,000 per store. The key is not expecting corner store owners to figure it out alone. Provide the equipment, the supplier connections, and the technical assistance, and healthy corner stores succeed.

**"This is too expensive."**
Diet-related disease costs Denver hundreds of millions in healthcare spending annually. Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and related conditions are concentrated in the same neighborhoods that lack food access. The American Diabetes Association estimates diabetes costs Colorado $5.5 billion per year. A $30-40M annual investment in food access is a fraction of what we already spend treating preventable disease. We can pay now for prevention or pay far more later for treatment. The math is not close.
