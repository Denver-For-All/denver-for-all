# DenverForAll.org — Funding Collateral

Application materials, outreach letters, and fundraising copy for securing funding for DenverForAll's policy research, civic tools, and organizing infrastructure.

## Recommended Path: Open Collective + Open Source Collective

After assessing traditional fiscal sponsors (Social Good Fund, Movement Strategy Center, Tides), **Open Collective with Open Source Collective as fiscal host** is the best fit:

- **Setup in days**, not weeks/months
- **Public real-time ledger** of every dollar — aligns with radical transparency values
- **10% fee** (comparable to alternatives)
- **No 501(c)(3) needed** — OSC is a 501(c)(6) that handles legal/tax
- **Trade-off:** Donations are not tax-deductible; most foundation grants require 501(c)(3). But at $200–800/month from small donors, grants are unnecessary for core operations.

See `fiscal-sponsorship/open-collective-assessment.md` for full analysis.

## Priority Timeline (4–8 Weeks)

### Week 1: Open Collective Setup (Do First)
- `fiscal-sponsorship/open-collective-assessment.md` — Full assessment, legal compliance, implementation steps
- `fundraising/transparency-statement.md` — Transparency & accountability statement for the website
- `fundraising/donation-page-copy.md` — Donation tiers, recurring copy, social sharing, email appeals

### Week 2–4: Network & Partner Outreach
- `outreach/local-progress-colorado.md` — Join network of progressive local officials
- `outreach/movement-voter-project.md` — Partner application for organizing funding
- `outreach/fund-for-housing-opportunity.md` — $50K–$140K housing research grants
- `outreach/colorado-health-foundation.md` — ~$100M/year, medical debt + housing-as-health
- `outreach/undue-medical-debt-partnership.md` — Denver medical debt campaign partner
- `outreach/institute-local-self-reliance.md` — Municipal broadband research partner

### If Grants Become Needed Later
- `fiscal-sponsorship/social-good-fund-application.md` — 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsor (8% fee, ~1 month)
- `fiscal-sponsorship/movement-strategy-center-inquiry.md` — Movement-focused fiscal sponsor
- `grants/denver-foundation-community-grants.md` — $20K–$50K (requires 501(c)(3))
- `grants/caring-for-denver-foundation.md` — $200K–$800K (requires 501(c)(3))

### Reusable Across All Applications
- `organizational-profile.md` — Core org description, mission, metrics, evidence

## Notes
- **Colorado Gives Foundation** 2026 Housing Grant is Jefferson County-specific, not Denver. Deprioritized.
- **Open Collective does not lock you out** of adding 501(c)(3) sponsorship later for specific grants.
- **Partnership outreach** (Undue Medical Debt, ILSR, Local Progress) does not require any fiscal status.
