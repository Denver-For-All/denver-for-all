## The Problem

In Denver, a landlord can file for eviction and a tenant can lose their home in as little as 48 hours in some cases. 90%+ of landlords in eviction court have attorneys. Less than 10% of tenants do. The system is designed for landlords - tenants are an afterthought.

Beyond eviction, tenants face:
- Retaliation for reporting code violations or organizing
- Illegal lockouts and utility shutoffs
- Security deposit theft (landlords keeping deposits without justification)
- Discrimination based on source of income, immigration status, or family status
- No meaningful voice in decisions that affect their homes

### What Denver Currently Does

Denver's current tenant protections are minimal. Colorado law provides for a 10-day notice to cure for nonpayment (C.R.S. 13-40-104) and a 21-day notice for month-to-month lease changes. Denver passed limited renter protections in 2023-2024, including a right to an attorney in certain eviction cases for income-qualified tenants. However, coverage remains partial -- not universal.

Denver County Court processed approximately 10,000+ eviction filings in 2023 (Colorado Judicial Branch data). The legal representation disparity is stark: a 2022 National Coalition for a Civil Right to Counsel analysis found landlords have attorneys in over 90% of eviction cases nationally, while fewer than 10% of tenants do -- a figure consistent with Denver County Court observations.

## Our Solution

### The Denver Tenant Bill of Rights Ordinance

**1. Universal Right to Counsel**
Every tenant facing eviction in Denver is entitled to a city-funded attorney, regardless of income. Not income-qualified - universal. Because losing your home is losing your home whether you make $30K or $60K.

- Funded through dedicated eviction defense fund
- Attorneys provided through contracts with legal aid organizations and the public defender's office
- Available from the moment of eviction filing through resolution
- Studies show right to counsel prevents 70-85% of evictions and saves cities money (reduced shelter costs, emergency services, school disruption)

**2. 90-Day Notice for Rent Increases**
Any rent increase requires 90 days written notice (currently 21 days for month-to-month in Colorado). This gives tenants real time to budget, negotiate, or find alternatives - not a scramble.

**3. Right of First Refusal**
When a rental building is sold, tenants and recognized tenant organizations have the right of first refusal to purchase the building - at the same price offered by the buyer. This enables tenant cooperatives and community land trust acquisitions.

**4. Anti-Retaliation Protections**
It is illegal for a landlord to raise rent, reduce services, or file for eviction within 12 months of a tenant:
- Filing a complaint with code enforcement
- Reporting a health or safety violation
- Organizing or joining a tenant union
- Testifying in court or administrative proceedings
- Exercising any right under this Bill of Rights

Burden of proof shifts to the landlord: if adverse action occurs within 12 months, retaliation is presumed and the landlord must prove otherwise.

**5. Right to Organize**
Tenants have the explicit right to form tenant unions, hold meetings in common areas, distribute literature, and collectively bargain with landlords over building conditions. Interference with tenant organizing is a violation with penalties.

**6. Habitability Standards and Enforcement**
- Detailed minimum habitability standards (heat, hot water, pest control, structural safety, mold remediation)
- Tenants may withhold rent and deposit into escrow when landlord fails to address habitability violations within 14 days
- City inspectors must respond to complaints within 72 hours
- Repeat violators placed on public landlord watch list

**7. Security Deposit Protections**
- Deposits capped at one month's rent
- Must be held in interest-bearing escrow account
- Itemized deduction list required within 30 days of move-out
- Failure to comply: landlord owes triple the deposit amount
- Photographic move-in/move-out documentation required

**8. Source of Income Protection**
Landlords cannot refuse tenants based on source of income - including Section 8 vouchers, Social Security, disability payments, veteran's benefits, child support, or any other lawful income source.

**9. Criminal History Protection**
Landlords cannot categorically deny housing based on criminal history. Individual assessment required, considering nature of offense, time elapsed, and evidence of rehabilitation. Arrests without conviction cannot be considered at all.

**10. Just Cause Eviction**
(See: Rent Stabilization Act for full just cause provisions)

## How We Pay For It

**Right to Counsel Program:** $8-12M/year
- Funded by: Eviction filing fee increase ($200 per filing, paid by landlord), portion of vacancy tax revenue, reallocation from emergency shelter spending (housing people is cheaper than sheltering them)
- Cost savings: NYC's right to counsel program saves the city $320M/year in avoided shelter costs. Denver would see proportional savings.

**Enforcement Office:** $2-3M/year
- Funded by: Landlord registration fees, violation penalty revenue

### International Evidence: Tenant Protections Are Standard Elsewhere

| Country | Model | Result |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **Germany** | Lifetime tenure by default; landlords can only terminate for narrow "just cause." *Mietervereine* (tenant associations) represent 3+ million members in housing disputes. Rent increases capped and regulated by local rent indexes (*Mietspiegel*). | One of the strongest tenant protection regimes in the world. Over 50% of Germans rent, and most consider it a stable, dignified way to live - not a stepping stone to ownership. |
| **France** | Standard residential leases are 3 years minimum (6 years for corporate landlords). Winter eviction ban (November-March) - no one is put on the street in winter, period. Landlords must provide relocation assistance for any eviction. | Strong protections create housing stability. Tenants can plan their lives. The idea of a 30-day eviction would be considered barbaric. |
| **Netherlands** | Rent tribunals (*Huurcommissie*) adjudicate disputes. Government sets maximum rents for most housing based on a points system. Tenants can challenge excessive rents retroactively. | Formal system ensures fairness. Tenants have institutional backing, not just a landlord's goodwill. |
| **Sweden** | Tenant unions (*Hyresgastforeningen*) collectively bargain rents with landlords on behalf of all tenants in a building or area. Over 500,000 members. Rents are negotiated, not dictated. | Collective bargaining for housing - tenants negotiate as a bloc. Keeps rents reasonable and gives tenants real power. |
| **New York City, US** | Universal right to counsel enacted 2017. City-funded attorneys for all tenants in eviction court in covered zip codes. | Evictions dropped 30%+ in covered areas. 84% of tenants with counsel kept their homes. Program saves the city $320M/year in avoided shelter costs. |

**The pattern is clear:** countries that treat tenants as rights-holders with institutional support have stable housing markets and lower homelessness. The US model of treating tenants as second-class citizens with minimal rights is the outlier, not the norm.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Won't this make landlords leave the market?"**
Good. If a landlord's business model requires the ability to illegally retaliate against tenants, steal security deposits, and evict without cause - they should leave the market. Their units will be purchased by better operators, tenant cooperatives, or the Social Housing Authority.

**"Universal right to counsel is too expensive."**
It saves money. Every $1 spent on right to counsel saves $4-6 in avoided shelter, emergency services, and social services costs. Housed people are healthier, their kids do better in school, and they contribute more to the economy.

**"Landlords need to be able to evict bad tenants."**
Nothing in this bill prevents eviction for legitimate cause - nonpayment (with cure period), lease violations, criminal activity. What it prevents is pretextual evictions, retaliatory evictions, and no-fault evictions without assistance.
