## 1. Denver Facebook Groups

### Why This Channel

Facebook groups are where Denver's non-Reddit population discusses local politics, neighborhood issues, and city services. The demographics skew older, more racially diverse, and more representative of the general electorate than Reddit. Many neighborhood associations, renter groups, and parent groups are active daily. People share articles, complain about landlords, and ask for recommendations — all natural entry points.

### Target Groups

**Tier 1 (high activity, issue-aligned):**

- Denver Community Forum / Denver Colorado Community (general city discussion, 50K+ members)
- Denver Renters / Denver Housing groups (housing-focused)
- Denver Parents / Denver Moms groups (childcare, education, cost-of-living angles)
- Denver Politics discussion groups

**Tier 2 (neighborhood-specific, useful for hyperlocal issues):**

- Montbello / Green Valley Ranch / Far Northeast Denver groups (underserved areas, healthcare gaps)
- Globeville / Elyria-Swansea / RiNo groups (displacement, gentrification)
- Capitol Hill / Baker / Barnum groups (high renter density)
- Park Hill / City Park neighborhood groups
- Westwood / Athmar Park / Southwest Denver groups (bilingual communities)

**Tier 3 (professional/identity-based):**

- Denver small business owner groups (small business policy angle)
- Denver teacher / education worker groups (wages, childcare)
- Denver service industry / restaurant worker groups (tipped wage, living wage)

### Rules of Engagement

1. **Join and lurk for 1-2 weeks before posting.** Understand the group's tone, norms, and hot-button topics.
2. **Respond to existing discussions first.** Your first 5-10 interactions should be helpful comments on other people's posts, not self-promotion.
3. **One link per thread, max.** Never dump multiple URLs. Reference a specific policy page only when it directly answers someone's question.
4. **No campaign-speak.** These are neighbors talking. Write like a person who did some research, not an organization pushing an agenda.
5. **Provide value before linking.** Give the substantive answer in the comment itself. The link is "if you want to read more" not "click here for the answer."
6. **Never post the same content to multiple groups.** Customize for each group's concerns.
7. **Respect group admins.** If they have no-politics or no-promotion rules, follow them. Some groups allow "resource sharing" — frame accordingly.
8. **Engage replies.** If someone pushes back, respond substantively. Ghosting after dropping a link looks like astroturfing.

### Sample Posts & Comments

#### Post 1: Housing Cost Thread (Denver Community Forum)

**Context:** Someone posts about getting a rent increase notice

> That's brutal, sorry you're dealing with that. Colorado is one of the few states where there's literally no limit on how much a landlord can raise rent — it's been illegal for cities to pass rent stabilization since 1981 (CRS § 38-12-301). That means Denver can't protect renters even if it wanted to.
>
> There's actually been a few attempts to repeal the state preemption — the closest was HB23-1115 which passed the full House in 2023 but got killed by one vote in a Senate committee. There's a policy breakdown of what Denver could do if the preemption was lifted at denverforall.org/platform/rent-control if anyone's interested.
>
> In the meantime, know your rights: landlords have to give 60 days notice for increases and can't retaliate if you complain about habitability issues. That's about all the protection we've got right now.

#### Post 2: Broadband Frustration (Neighborhood Group)

**Context:** Someone complains about Comcast bill or outage

> Fun fact that most people don't know: Denver voters already approved municipal broadband in 2018. Ballot Measure 2J, passed with 85% of the vote. Seven years later, we still don't have it.
>
> Meanwhile Longmont built NextLight — $50/month for gigabit, profitable within 5 years, 90%+ customer satisfaction. Fort Collins built Connexion even after Comcast spent $150M trying to stop them.
>
> Denver voters said yes, and then nothing happened. There's a full breakdown of what a Denver fiber network would look like (including a proposed $30/month price point and free tier for low-income households) at denverforall.org/platform/municipal-broadband.

#### Post 3: Cost of Living / Wages (Parent Group)

**Context:** Thread about childcare costs or general cost-of-living squeeze

> The MIT Living Wage Calculator says a family of four in Denver needs $25-26/hr with both parents working. Denver minimum wage is $18.81. That's a $7/hr gap between what people earn and what they need to survive — and that's with two incomes.
>
> Single parent with one kid? MIT says you need $42-44/hr. That's not a policy debate, that's a math problem.
>
> Seven states already eliminated the tipped minimum wage entirely and their restaurant industries are fine. Denmark pays fast food workers $22/hr and a Big Mac costs 80 cents more.

#### Comment 4: Medical Debt (Any Group)

**Context:** Someone shares a medical bill horror story

> This is wild but there's a real solution to this. Cities like Toledo, New Orleans, and Chicago have partnered with Undue Medical Debt to buy medical debt portfolios at pennies on the dollar and cancel them. A $5M city appropriation can forgive $100-500M in actual debt.
>
> Denver Health is a public hospital and it still sends patients to collections and puts liens on homes. There's a policy proposal to do what those other cities did — denverforall.org/platform/healthcare has the full breakdown.

## 2. Nextdoor

### Why This Channel

Nextdoor is hyper-local, verified by address, and attracts politically engaged homeowners and long-term renters. The user base skews older and more moderate than Reddit. Discussions about crime, traffic, development, and city services happen daily. The platform's neighborhood structure means your content reaches the exact people affected by specific policies.

### Rules of Engagement

1. **Your profile is your address.** Everything you post is tied to your real neighborhood. Be authentic.
2. **Lead with neighborhood impact, not ideology.** "Here's what this means for our block" not "here's what the movement believes."
3. **Homeowner-friendly framing matters here.** Many Nextdoor users are homeowners. Frame policies in terms of property values, neighborhood stability, and quality of life — not just renter protections.
4. **Use the "General" or "Politics" topics.** Don't post political content in "Recommendations" or "Safety."
5. **No links in initial posts if possible.** Nextdoor's algorithm suppresses posts with external links. Put the substance in the post. Add the link in a follow-up comment if someone asks for more info.
6. **Keep it to 1-2 posts per month.** Nextdoor communities are small. Overposting gets you muted or flagged.

### Sample Posts

#### Post 1: Vacancy / Abandoned Properties

> Has anyone else noticed vacant properties in [neighborhood]? There are at least [X] on my block alone — just sitting empty while rents keep climbing.
>
> I've been looking into what other cities do about this and it turns out Vancouver, Melbourne, and Washington DC all have vacancy taxes. Vancouver's generated $115M+ in revenue since 2017 and their vacancy rate dropped from 4.3% to under 1% in the first two years.
>
> Denver doesn't even have a vacancy registry — we literally don't track how many units are sitting empty. Seems like step one would be counting them.

#### Post 2: Internet / Broadband

> I pay $95/month for Comcast and my speed test just came back at half of what I'm paying for. Again.
>
> Something I found out recently that blew my mind: we already voted to authorize municipal broadband. 85% of Denver voters said yes in 2018. Seven years and nothing happened.
>
> Longmont's city-owned internet is $50/month for gigabit. Fort Collins built theirs despite Comcast spending $150M to fight it. What exactly is the holdup here?

#### Post 3: STAR Program / Public Safety

> Wanted to share something positive. The STAR program (Support Team Assisted Response) — the mental health crisis teams that respond instead of police for certain calls — just got evaluated by the Urban Institute. Results: 16% reduction in subsequent arrests, with even bigger impacts for people experiencing homelessness.
>
> They've handled over 23,000 calls since going citywide in 2022. Problem is they're funded at $4.4M and can only cover about 45% of eligible calls. Seems like expanding something with a proven track record would be common sense.

## 3. Local Media Op-Eds & Letters

### Why This Channel

Op-eds and letters to the editor reach politically engaged Denver residents, get indexed by search engines (SEO value), create citable references for future advocacy, and signal to elected officials that constituents are paying attention. A single well-placed op-ed in the Denver Post or Denverite can generate more credibility than months of social media posting.

### Target Outlets

**Tier 1 (highest reach, hardest placement):**

- **The Denver Post** — Op-eds (750-800 words), Letters to Editor (200 words). Email: opinion@denverpost.com
- **Colorado Sun** — Guest commentary (800-1000 words). More progressive, data-friendly editorial stance.
- **Denverite** — Community voices, neighborhood reporting angles. Most accessible for first-time writers.

**Tier 2 (targeted reach, easier placement):**

- **Westword** — Longform opinion, investigative angles. Good for provocative framings.
- **Colorado Newsline** — State politics angle, legislative strategy pieces.
- **Colorado Public Radio / CPR News** — Commentary section, less frequent but high credibility.

**Tier 3 (hyperlocal, low barrier):**

- **North Denver Tribune**, **Greater Park Hill News**, **Southwest Denver Coalition newsletter**
- **Denver Voice** (street newspaper — direct reach to homeless and low-income population)
- Neighborhood association newsletters (direct pitch to editors)

### Op-Ed Strategy

**Timing is everything.** Don't pitch cold. Pitch when:

- A relevant news story breaks (rent increase data, council vote, sweep, Comcast outage)
- A legislative session is active (state preemption repeal attempts)
- Budget season (city budget debates — participatory budgeting angle)
- Election cycle (candidate positions, voter guides)

**Hook + Data + Denver-specific + Call to Action** is the formula.

### Sample Op-Ed: Municipal Broadband (Denver Post / Colorado Sun)

**Title:** Denver Voters Said Yes to Municipal Broadband Seven Years Ago. What Happened?

> In November 2018, Denver voters passed Ballot Measure 2J with 85% support, authorizing the city to build a municipal broadband network. It wasn't close. It wasn't controversial. More than eight in ten voters said: yes, we want this.
>
> Seven years later, Denver residents still pay Comcast and CenturyLink $80-120/month for internet that routinely underdelivers on speed, imposes data caps, and provides some of the worst customer service in American commerce.
>
> Thirty miles north, Longmont tells a different story. The city's publicly owned NextLight network offers gigabit internet for $50/month. It reached profitability within five years. Customer satisfaction exceeds 90%. Fort Collins built its own network, Connexion, despite Comcast spending $150 million on opposition campaigns — and it's on track for profitability too.
>
> These aren't experiments. These are municipal services that work, pay for themselves, and save residents hundreds of dollars a year.
>
> Denver's inaction isn't a technology problem or a funding problem. It's a political will problem. The question voters should be asking every council member and every mayoral candidate: we gave you permission seven years ago. What exactly is the holdup?
>
> A detailed proposal for Denver's municipal fiber network — including a $30/month price point, free tier for low-income households, and net neutrality guarantee — is available at denverforall.org. The engineering is straightforward. The economics are proven. The voters already said yes. All that's missing is leadership willing to do what the public demanded.

**Word count:** ~250 (expand to 750-800 with additional Denver-specific data, resident quotes, and more detailed Longmont/Fort Collins comparison)

### Sample Letter to the Editor: Medical Debt (Denver Post)

> To the Editor:
>
> Toledo forgave $240 million in medical debt for a $1.6 million investment. New Orleans did $130 million. Chicago, Cook County, and a growing list of cities are partnering with Undue Medical Debt to buy debt portfolios at pennies on the dollar and cancel them — no strings attached.
>
> Denver Health is a public hospital. It still sends patients to collections and places liens on homes. A $5 million city appropriation could forgive $100-500 million in medical debt for Denver residents. The mechanism exists. The precedent exists. The money exists.
>
> What's missing is a council member willing to introduce the ordinance.

**Word count:** ~110

### Sample Letter to the Editor: STAR Program (Denverite)

> The Urban Institute just released an independent evaluation of Denver's STAR program showing a 16% reduction in arrests and police contacts among people who received STAR response. For people experiencing homelessness, the effects were 2-3x larger.
>
> STAR has responded to over 23,000 calls since expanding citywide. But at $4.4 million in funding, it can only reach about 45% of eligible calls. We have a program that works, with rigorous evidence proving it, and we're funding it at less than half capacity.
>
> If we can find $200 million for the Department of Housing Stability, we can find $20 million for a mental health crisis program that's actually reducing the burden on police and emergency services. Expand STAR.

**Word count:** ~130

## 4. Reddit AMAs & Discussion Posts

### Why This Channel

Your Reddit comment strategy (`REDDIT-COMMENTS.md`) is working for organic engagement. The next level is owning the conversation: structured discussion posts and AMAs that position Denver For All as a credible policy resource rather than just a commenter.

### Target Subreddits

- **r/Denver** (~450K members) — Primary. Tolerates policy discussion if substantive. Self-posts with data do well.
- **r/denverhousing** — Smaller but highly targeted. Housing policy is on-topic by definition.
- **r/ColoradoPolitics** — State-level framing for rent control preemption, TABOR, legislative strategy.
- **r/urbanplanning** — National audience interested in Denver case studies (broadband, social housing, vacancy tax).

### Post Types

**Type 1: Data Drop Post**
A self-post presenting original analysis or a compiled dataset with a clear takeaway. Not a link to your site — the substance is in the post itself. Site link is supplementary.

**Type 2: "What Denver Could Learn From..." Post**
Case study format comparing Denver to a city that's implemented a policy you advocate for. Longmont broadband, Vienna social housing, Helsinki Housing First.

**Type 3: AMA / Discussion Thread**
"We built a policy platform for Denver covering 45 proposals. AMA." This works best after you've established credibility through Type 1 and Type 2 posts.

### Sample Post: Data Drop (r/Denver)

**Title:** I compiled the actual numbers on Denver's affordable housing spending. The per-unit costs are wild.

> I've been digging into Denver HOST (Department of Housing Stability) budget data and LIHTC project costs. Here's what I found:
>
> - Denver produces approximately 500-800 affordable units per year through subsidized development
> - Per-unit subsidy costs range from $400,000 to $600,000
> - These units have affordability restrictions that expire after 15-30 years, then revert to market rate
> - Thousands of existing LIHTC units are approaching expiration right now
>
> For comparison:
>
> - Vienna's social housing program builds permanently affordable units at significantly lower per-unit costs through public ownership
> - The units never expire because the city owns them
> - Vienna's program is self-sustaining through rental revenue
>
> Denver's current model is: spend half a million dollars per unit of public money, give it to a private developer, and get a temporarily affordable apartment that becomes luxury housing in 20 years.
>
> I'm part of a group that put together a full policy platform for Denver (denverforall.org) — the social housing proposal is one of 45 policies. But the numbers above are just public data. Make of them what you will.
>
> Happy to answer questions or get told why I'm wrong.

### Sample Post: Case Study (r/Denver)

**Title:** Longmont's municipal internet is $50/month for gigabit and profitable. Denver voters approved the same thing in 2018. What happened?

> I keep seeing Comcast complaint threads so here's a comparison that makes me want to scream:
>
> |                       | Longmont NextLight   | Denver (Comcast) |
> | --------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- |
> | Gigabit price         | $50/month            | $80-120/month    |
> | Data caps             | None                 | Yes              |
> | Customer satisfaction | 90%+                 | LOL              |
> | Public ownership      | Yes                  | No               |
> | Profitable            | Yes (within 5 years) | N/A              |
>
> Denver voters passed Measure 2J in 2018 with **85% approval** authorizing municipal broadband. Fort Collins built theirs despite Comcast spending $150M to stop it.
>
> Seven years. 85% voter approval. And we're still paying Comcast for internet that doesn't deliver what we pay for.
>
> There's a full proposal for what a Denver municipal fiber network could look like at denverforall.org/platform/municipal-broadband — $30/month target, free tier for low-income households, net neutrality guaranteed. But honestly the question isn't about the plan. The plan is straightforward. The question is why nobody at city hall has done what voters told them to do in 2018.

## 5. Spanish-Language Community Outreach

### Why This Channel

Approximately 30% of Denver residents are Hispanic/Latino. Many get their local information through Spanish-language media, community organizations, churches, and WhatsApp/Facebook groups — not English-language Reddit or the Denver Post. If Denver For All doesn't exist in Spanish, it doesn't exist for a third of the city.

### Priority Actions

**Immediate (before any Spanish-language outreach):**

1. Translate the 5 flagship policies in full (not just titles/summaries):
   - Social Housing (La Ley de Vivienda Social de Denver)
   - Rent Stabilization (Ley de Estabilización de Alquileres)
   - Living Wage (Salario Mínimo de $25)
   - Healthcare (La Salud como un Derecho)
   - Immigration / Sanctuary (policies across all 4 immigration docs)
2. Ensure all tools (rent calculator, eviction tracker, know-your-rights chatbot) function in Spanish
3. Create Spanish-language versions of shareable one-pagers (see Section 6)

### Target Channels

**Spanish-language media:**

- **La Voz Bilingüe** — Colorado's oldest bilingual newspaper. Op-eds and community announcements.
- **Univision Denver / KCEC-TV** — Local Univision affiliate. Press releases for newsworthy policy positions (medical debt, sanctuary city, living wage).
- **Telemundo Denver / KDEN-TV** — Same as above.
- **El Comercio de Colorado** — Digital publication, community-oriented.
- **Radio stations:** La Tricolor (KBNO 1280 AM), Radio Romantica, other Spanish-language AM/FM stations — call-in opportunities, community bulletin announcements.

**Community organizations (partnership, not competition):**

- **Clinica Tepeyac** — Health services in Globeville/Elyria-Swansea. Healthcare policy alignment.
- **Centro Humanitario** — Day laborer center. Living wage, gig worker protections alignment.
- **CIRC (Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition)** — Immigration policy alignment.
- **Padres & Jóvenes Unidos** — Education and youth justice. Education and youth services policy alignment.
- **Focus Points Family Resource Center** — Globeville/Elyria-Swansea. Multiple policy alignments.
- **Mi Casa Resource Center** — Workforce development. Living wage, small business alignment.

**Approach:** Partner, don't colonize. These organizations have existing trust and relationships. Offer your policy research as a resource they can use in their own advocacy. Don't show up asking them to promote your brand.

**Facebook/WhatsApp groups:**

- Denver-area Latino/Hispanic community Facebook groups
- Neighborhood WhatsApp groups in Westwood, Athmar Park, Southwest Denver, Globeville/Elyria-Swansea
- Church and parish community groups (Our Lady of Guadalupe, Presentation of Our Lady, etc.)

### Sample Content: Spanish-Language Facebook Post

**Context:** Housing cost discussion in a Denver Latino community group

> ¿Sabían que en Colorado es ilegal que Denver controle los aumentos de alquiler? Desde 1981, una ley estatal (CRS § 38-12-301) prohíbe que cualquier ciudad en Colorado ponga límites a los aumentos de renta. Tu casero puede subir la renta lo que quiera con solo 60 días de aviso.
>
> Los alquileres en Denver han subido casi 85% desde 2010. Un apartamento de una recámara promedia más de $1,600/mes. Para una familia que gana el salario mínimo, eso es más de la mitad de su ingreso.
>
> Hay un grupo que armó propuestas detalladas para Denver — vivienda social, estabilización de rentas, salario de $25/hora, perdón de deuda médica. Todo en español en denverforall.org. No son políticos, son vecinos con investigación.
>
> Lo que más me impresionó: Denver gasta $400,000-600,000 por unidad subsidiando a desarrolladores privados para construir viviendas "asequibles" que dejan de serlo en 15-30 años. Viena construye vivienda pública permanente por menos. Hay otra manera de hacer esto.

### Sample Content: Outreach to Community Organization

**Email template for partnership outreach:**

> Subject: Policy research resource for [organization name] — Denver For All
>
> Hi [name],
>
> I'm with Denver For All, a grassroots group that put together data-driven policy proposals for Denver covering housing, wages, healthcare, and immigration.
>
> I know [organization name] does critical work on [their issue area]. We have a detailed policy proposal on [relevant policy] that includes international evidence, implementation mechanisms, and cost analysis — and we're working on full Spanish translations.
>
> We're not asking you to endorse anything. We just want to offer our research as a resource if it's useful for your advocacy. We'd also love your feedback — you know these issues on the ground better than we do.
>
> Would you be open to a 15-minute conversation? Happy to send the policy doc in advance.
>
> [Name]
> denverforall.org

## 6. Shareable One-Pagers for Group Chats

### Why This Channel

The most persuasive political communication in 2025 is a screenshot or PDF shared in a group chat. People trust what their friends and family send them in Signal, WhatsApp, iMessage, and Facebook Messenger more than anything they see on social media or news sites. A clean, scannable one-pager that answers "what is this and why should I care" in 30 seconds is the most underleveraged asset in grassroots organizing.

### Design Specifications

**Format:** PDF, optimized for mobile viewing (readable on a phone without zooming)
**Dimensions:** Single page, letter size (8.5x11) or square (1080x1080 for social sharing)
**File size:** Under 500KB (loads fast on mobile data)

**Structure for each one-pager:**

1. **Headline** — The problem in one sentence (large, bold)
2. **Three numbers** — Key data points with large typography
3. **What we propose** — 3-4 bullet points, plain language, no jargon
4. **What other cities did** — 1-2 proof points with city name and result
5. **QR code + URL** — Links to full policy page on denverforall.org
6. **Bilingual** — English on one side, Spanish on the other (or side-by-side)

### Priority One-Pagers to Create

| #   | Policy              | Headline                                                                                | Key Numbers                                                                   |
| --- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Social Housing      | "Denver spends $500K/unit for temporary affordable housing. There's a better way."      | $400-600K per unit subsidy, 15-30 year expiration, 7,500 homeless             |
| 2   | Rent Control        | "Your landlord can raise your rent by any amount. There's no limit in Colorado."        | 85% rent increase since 2010, $1,600 avg 1BR, zero protection                 |
| 3   | Living Wage         | "Denver minimum wage: $18.81. Cost of living in Denver: $25-26/hr."                     | $7/hr gap, $42-44/hr for single parents, MIT data                             |
| 4   | Municipal Broadband | "85% of Denver voters said yes to city internet in 2018. We're still paying Comcast."   | 85% voter approval, 7 years waiting, $50 vs $100/month                        |
| 5   | Medical Debt        | "$5 million can forgive $100-500 million in medical debt. Other cities already did it." | Toledo: $240M forgiven for $1.6M, Denver Health sends patients to collections |
| 6   | STAR Program        | "Denver's mental health crisis teams work. They just need funding."                     | 23,000+ calls, 16% arrest reduction, only 45% of calls covered                |

### Production Options

- **DIY:** Canva (free tier) with the site's existing color palette and typography
- **Professional:** Commission a designer for the first 2-3, then use as templates for the rest
- **Developer option:** Generate PDFs programmatically from policy frontmatter data using a build script (Astro can output non-HTML with custom endpoints)

### Distribution Strategy

- Share in the Facebook groups, Nextdoor posts, and Reddit comments as supplementary material
- Provide to partner organizations (Section 5) for their own distribution
- Hand out at community events, council meetings, neighborhood association meetings
- Pin to top of Signal/WhatsApp organizing groups
- Include in email newsletter (EmailOctopus) as downloadable attachments

## 8. Metrics & Tracking

### What to Measure

You're already seeing traffic growth (469 unique visitors, 4.91K requests over 7 days per Cloudflare). Track these to understand what's working:

**Traffic (Cloudflare Analytics):**

- Unique visitors per week (current baseline: ~470)
- Top referrers (which channels send the most traffic)
- Top pages (which policies get the most views)
- Geographic distribution (are visitors in Denver?)

**Engagement:**

- Reddit: upvotes/comments on discussion posts, comment karma on organic comments
- Facebook: reactions/comments on posts in groups
- Nextdoor: reactions/comments, any DMs or follow-up questions
- Op-eds: whether they're published, any reader response

**Conversion:**

- Newsletter signups (EmailOctopus — track which referral source drives signups)
- Volunteer form submissions (Google Forms)
- Tool usage (eviction tracker, rent calculator, campaign finance — Cloudflare Workers analytics)

**Organizing:**

- Community orgs contacted vs. partnerships formed
- Spanish-language content completion rate
- Event attendance if applicable

### Attribution

Add UTM parameters to links shared on different channels so Cloudflare (or any analytics you add later) can distinguish traffic sources:

- Reddit: `denverforall.org/platform/rent-control?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=comment&utm_campaign=housing`
- Facebook: `denverforall.org/platform/rent-control?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=group&utm_campaign=housing`
- Nextdoor: `denverforall.org/platform/municipal-broadband?utm_source=nextdoor&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=broadband`
- Op-ed: `denverforall.org?utm_source=denverpost&utm_medium=oped&utm_campaign=broadband`
- One-pager QR code: `denverforall.org/platform/social-housing?utm_source=onepager&utm_medium=qr&utm_campaign=housing`

## Appendix: What NOT to Do

1. **Don't pastebin-spam.** Pastebin sites are audience-mismatched, SEO-worthless, and reputationally risky (see discussion that prompted this playbook).
2. **Don't mass-post identical content across platforms.** Each channel has its own tone, norms, and audience. Customize.
3. **Don't argue with trolls.** Respond once substantively if the audience might learn something. Then disengage.
4. **Don't lead with the organization.** Lead with the issue, the data, the solution. Denver For All is the "if you want more" not the headline.
5. **Don't outpace your content quality.** The COMMUNICATIONS-REVIEW.md identifies real gaps (missing citations, FAQ blind spots, no Spanish translations). Fix flagship content before driving traffic to it.
6. **Don't compete with allies.** If CIRC, Clinica Tepeyac, or Centro Humanitario are already advocating on an issue, amplify them rather than publishing parallel content. Coalition > competition.
