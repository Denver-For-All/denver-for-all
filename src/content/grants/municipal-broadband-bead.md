## Project Narrative

### A. Project Description

**Project Title:** Denver Municipal Fiber Broadband Network — Phase 1 Underserved Neighborhoods

**Applicant:** City and County of Denver, Technology Services / Denver Municipal Broadband Authority

**Subgrant Requested From:** Colorado Broadband Office (BEAD Program Administrator)

**Requested Amount:** $34,000,000

**Project Duration:** 48 months

**Project Summary:** The City and County of Denver requests $34 million in BEAD subgrant funding through the Colorado Broadband Office to construct the first phase of Denver's city-owned fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP) broadband network. Denver voters authorized municipal broadband in 2018 by an overwhelming 85% margin (Measure 2J), yet seven years later no network has been built. Denver residents remain captive to a Comcast/CenturyLink duopoly charging $80-120/month for speeds that consistently fall short of advertised rates, while low-income neighborhoods experience systematic underinvestment — digital redlining — that leaves residents with the worst service and the fewest options. This project will deploy backbone and last-mile fiber infrastructure to approximately 20,000-30,000 unserved and underserved addresses in Denver's highest-need neighborhoods, deliver gigabit-symmetric service at $30/month with a free tier for qualifying low-income households, and establish digital equity programs including device access and digital literacy training.

### B. Location & Context

**Project Area:** City and County of Denver, Colorado (population ~715,000)

**Priority Neighborhoods (ranked by broadband underservice, poverty rate, and digital redlining indicators):**
- Montbello
- East Colfax
- Elyria-Swansea
- Globeville
- Sun Valley
- Westwood
- Valverde
- Northeast Park Hill
- West Colfax
- Lincoln Park
- Barnum / Barnum West
- Villa Park
- Ruby Hill
- College View / South Platte

**Urbanized Area:** Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area

**Disadvantaged Community Status:** The majority of target neighborhoods qualify as disadvantaged communities under the Justice40 initiative and meet BEAD prioritization criteria for unserved (below 25/3 Mbps) and underserved (below 100/20 Mbps) locations based on FCC broadband maps, Census tract-level poverty rates, and documented service quality complaints.

### C. Problem Identification: The Broadband Affordability and Access Crisis

Denver's broadband market demonstrates the failures of an uncompetitive duopoly and the urgent need for a publicly owned alternative:

**Market Failure and Pricing:**
- Comcast and CenturyLink operate as an effective duopoly across Denver, with most residents having at most two wired broadband options and many having only one
- Monthly costs range from $80-120/month for broadband service, with prices rising annually
- Advertised speeds routinely exceed actual delivered speeds, particularly during peak hours
- Data caps and hidden fees inflate costs beyond advertised prices
- Denver residents pay among the highest broadband prices in the state for inconsistent service quality

**Digital Redlining and Equity:**
- Low-income neighborhoods and communities of color receive systematically worse broadband infrastructure investment from incumbent providers
- CenturyLink legacy DSL areas — concentrated in lower-income neighborhoods — deliver speeds well below the 100/20 Mbps underserved threshold
- Residents in underserved neighborhoods lack meaningful competitive alternatives
- The digital divide directly compounds educational, economic, and healthcare disparities

**Voter Mandate Without Execution:**
- In November 2018, Denver voters passed Measure 2J with 85% approval, authorizing the city to build and operate a municipal broadband network
- Seven years after voter authorization, no municipal network has been built
- The democratic mandate of 85% of Denver voters remains unfulfilled

**Proven Municipal Broadband Model:**
- Longmont NextLight, just 30 miles from Denver, delivers gigabit-symmetric fiber at $50/month, achieved profitability within 5 years, and maintains over 90% customer satisfaction
- Fort Collins Connexion is on track for profitability despite $150 million in opposition spending by Comcast to prevent its creation
- Over 900 communities across the United States operate municipal broadband networks
- Municipal networks consistently deliver faster speeds, lower prices, higher satisfaction, and reinvest revenue locally rather than extracting it to distant shareholders

### D. Project Activities & Deliverables

**Activity 1: Backbone Fiber Infrastructure in Underserved Neighborhoods ($15,000,000)**
- Design and construct backbone fiber ring connecting Denver's 14 priority underserved neighborhoods
- Install approximately 80-120 miles of backbone fiber conduit and cable along public rights-of-way
- Deploy neighborhood aggregation points and distribution hubs
- Engineer network for future expansion to full citywide buildout ($300-500M total estimated capital cost)
- Ensure all infrastructure is city-owned, open-access capable, and built to a minimum 30-year service life

**Activity 2: Last-Mile Fiber-to-the-Premises ($12,000,000)**
- Extend fiber-to-the-premises connections to approximately 20,000-30,000 unserved and underserved residential addresses in target neighborhoods
- Deliver gigabit-symmetric service (1 Gbps upload / 1 Gbps download) to all connected premises
- Offer service at $30/month for gigabit tier — less than half the cost of comparable incumbent offerings
- Provision a free tier (minimum 100/100 Mbps) for households qualifying under the Affordable Connectivity Program income thresholds or equivalent local criteria
- Install customer premises equipment (ONT, router) at no cost to subscribers

**Activity 3: Digital Equity Programs ($3,000,000)**
- Establish free-tier broadband provisioning for qualifying low-income households across all connected neighborhoods
- Partner with Denver Public Libraries, Denver Public Schools, and community organizations to distribute devices (laptops, tablets) to qualifying households
- Fund digital literacy training programs in each target neighborhood, with curricula covering basic computing, internet safety, telehealth access, remote work skills, and online government services
- Provide multilingual outreach and enrollment assistance for non-English-speaking residents
- Target enrollment of at least 3,000 households in the free tier within the first 24 months

**Activity 4: Network Operations Center and Staffing ($2,000,000)**
- Establish a Denver Municipal Broadband Network Operations Center (NOC) for 24/7 network monitoring and customer support
- Hire and train local operations staff, prioritizing hiring from target neighborhoods
- Deploy network management, billing, and customer relationship management systems
- Establish service level agreements (SLAs) guaranteeing minimum speed, uptime, and response time commitments to all subscribers

**Activity 5: Planning, Engineering, and Community Engagement ($2,000,000)**
- Complete detailed engineering design for backbone and last-mile routes in all 14 target neighborhoods
- Conduct environmental and permitting reviews for all construction corridors
- Execute a comprehensive community engagement campaign: minimum 3 public meetings per target neighborhood, online feedback portal, and multilingual outreach materials
- Develop a financial sustainability plan demonstrating long-term network viability through subscriber revenue
- Produce a replicable deployment playbook for subsequent phases of citywide buildout

### E. Project Timeline

| Phase | Timeline | Key Milestones |
|---|---|---|
| **Planning & Engineering** | Months 1-9 | Complete network engineering design, secure permits, execute community engagement round 1, hire core staff |
| **Procurement** | Months 6-12 | Issue RFPs for fiber construction, equipment, and operations systems; award contracts (overlaps with planning for phased corridors) |
| **Backbone Construction** | Months 10-24 | Complete backbone fiber ring connecting all 14 target neighborhoods, deploy aggregation hubs |
| **Last-Mile Deployment Phase 1** | Months 18-36 | Fiber-to-the-premises connections active in first 8 neighborhoods (~12,000-15,000 addresses); begin subscriber enrollment and free-tier provisioning |
| **Last-Mile Deployment Phase 2** | Months 30-42 | Complete remaining 6 neighborhoods (~8,000-15,000 additional addresses); digital equity programs fully operational |
| **Closeout & Evaluation** | Months 40-48 | Post-deployment speed and reliability audits, subscriber satisfaction survey, financial sustainability assessment, final report to Colorado Broadband Office |

### F. Alignment with BEAD Program Goals

This project directly advances the goals of the NTIA Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment program as administered through the Colorado Broadband Office:

1. **Deploys broadband to unserved and underserved locations:** Targets approximately 20,000-30,000 addresses in neighborhoods where residents lack access to reliable 100/20 Mbps service or have no competitive alternative to a single incumbent provider
2. **Delivers service meeting BEAD technical standards:** Gigabit-symmetric fiber-to-the-premises (1 Gbps/1 Gbps) exceeds the BEAD minimum service standard of 100/20 Mbps and provides a future-proof, scalable platform
3. **Ensures affordability:** The $30/month gigabit tier and free tier for low-income households directly address BEAD's low-cost service plan requirements, at price points dramatically below incumbent offerings
4. **Prioritizes unserved locations, then underserved:** Phased deployment sequence prioritizes neighborhoods with the worst existing service before expanding to adjacent underserved areas
5. **Advances digital equity:** Integrated digital equity programming — free service tier, device distribution, digital literacy training — aligns with BEAD's requirement to promote adoption beyond deployment
6. **Provides long-term sustainability:** Municipal ownership ensures the network operates as a permanent public asset with subscriber-funded operations, not a grant-dependent program that disappears when funding ends

### G. Demonstrated Local Commitment and Financial Sustainability

Denver has established a strong foundation for municipal broadband and is prepared to provide meaningful local investment:

- **Measure 2J (2018):** Denver voters authorized municipal broadband by an 85% margin — one of the strongest broadband mandates of any city in the country
- **Revenue bond financing for local match:** Denver will issue revenue bonds backed by projected subscriber fees to fund the local match and future phases of citywide buildout, following the proven financing model used by Longmont NextLight and Fort Collins Connexion
- **Full citywide buildout plan:** The BEAD-funded phase represents the critical first deployment of a planned citywide fiber network ($300-500M total estimated capital cost), with subsequent phases funded through subscriber revenue and additional bond issuances
- **Longmont NextLight precedent:** A comparable Colorado municipal fiber network 30 miles from Denver achieved profitability within 5 years, demonstrating that front-range municipal fiber networks generate sufficient subscriber revenue to repay capital investment and sustain operations
- **Existing city infrastructure:** Denver can leverage existing city-owned conduit, rights-of-way, and public facilities to reduce construction costs and accelerate deployment
- **Public accountability:** As a city-owned utility, the network will be governed by elected officials, subject to public records requirements, and accountable to Denver residents — not distant shareholders

## How to Use This Template

This grant proposal template is designed for city staff, council members, and community advocates to adapt for an actual BEAD subgrant application to the Colorado Broadband Office:

1. **Monitor the Colorado Broadband Office subgrant timeline** at [coloradobroadband.org](https://coloradobroadband.org/) — BEAD funding flows from NTIA to states, and the Colorado Broadband Office administers subgrant applications on its own timeline
2. **Verify unserved/underserved location data** using the latest FCC Broadband Data Collection maps and any Colorado Broadband Office challenge process results for Denver addresses
3. **Refine the budget** based on current fiber construction cost estimates, make-ready engineering assessments, and Colorado Broadband Office match requirements
4. **Develop the required low-cost service plan** in detail per BEAD NOFO requirements, including the $30/month gigabit tier and free tier eligibility criteria
5. **Prepare the local match commitment** — coordinate with Denver Finance on revenue bond authorization and any additional city funding commitments required by the Colorado Broadband Office
6. **Add required state and federal forms** as specified in the Colorado Broadband Office subgrant application package
7. **Coordinate with the Denver Technology Services department** and any existing municipal broadband planning staff for submission

Note: BEAD is a $42.5 billion federal program — the largest broadband infrastructure investment in United States history. Funding flows from NTIA to state broadband offices, which then administer subgrants to eligible applicants. Denver's application would be submitted to the Colorado Broadband Office, not directly to NTIA. The subgrant timeline, match requirements, and application format are determined by the Colorado Broadband Office and may differ from the federal NOFO.
