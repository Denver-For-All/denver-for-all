## Inquiry Letter

**Subject:** Grant Inquiry — Denver For All Housing Research & Civic Tools Platform

Dear Fund for Housing and Opportunity team,

I'm writing to inquire about grant opportunities for Denver For All (denverforall.org), a grassroots civic organization producing housing policy research, building free civic tools, and organizing tenants in Denver, Colorado.

### Our Housing Work

Denver For All has built one of the most comprehensive municipal housing policy research platforms in Colorado:

**9 housing policy proposals, each with full evidence base:**

- Social Housing (10,000 publicly-owned units modeled on Vienna's system)
- Rent Stabilization (CPI or 3% cap, no vacancy decontrol) + detailed legislative history of Colorado's 1981 preemption
- Community Land Trusts (permanent affordability through non-profit land ownership)
- Vacancy Tax (revenue model based on Vancouver's 25% vacancy reduction)
- Housing First (Finland model — 35% homelessness reduction)
- Tenant Bill of Rights (comprehensive protections)
- Corporate Landlord Ban (blocking institutional investors from residential purchases)
- Anti-Displacement (neighborhood stabilization, community control)
- Source-of-Income Discrimination Ban (ready for immediate council introduction)

**Free civic tools serving Denver tenants:**

- Eviction tracker mapping displacement by neighborhood and landlord (Princeton Eviction Lab + Colorado Judicial Branch data)
- Rent calculator showing household savings under rent stabilization
- 24/7 AI tenant rights chatbot in English and Spanish
- Campaign finance tracker exposing real estate PAC influence on housing votes

**Federal grant templates:**

- HUD HOME for Community Land Trust expansion ($8–12M)
- HUD Continuum of Care for Housing First implementation

### Denver's Housing Crisis by the Numbers

- Rents up 82–85% since 2010 (Zillow ZORI)
- Average 1BR rent: $1,600/month
- 50%+ of Denver residents are renters
- Low-income rent burden: 50–70% of income
- 9,065 people experiencing homelessness (MDHI, 2024)
- ~150,000 eviction filings statewide 2017–2021 (Enterprise Community Partners)
- Outside spending in Denver elections: up 380% (2019–2023), driven by real estate PACs

### What Funding Would Support

1. **Housing research expansion** ($30,000–$60,000): Deep analysis of Denver's displacement patterns, eviction court data, corporate ownership concentration, and policy modeling
2. **Eviction tracker development** ($10,000–$30,000): Real-time data integration, neighborhood-level dashboards, tenant resource connections
3. **Community engagement** ($10,000–$30,000): Bilingual outreach, community forums, tenant organizing support
4. **Policy advocacy** ($10,000–$20,000): Candidate accountability on housing issues, Resistbot campaigns, council testimony support

### Organizational Model

Denver For All operates on under $840/year with 100% volunteer labor. We are pursuing fiscal sponsorship through Social Good Fund to accept tax-deductible donations and foundation grants. Our open-source, public-domain model ensures all research and tools are permanently free.

We currently reach ~600 unique visitors per week and are growing. We are comparable in scope to grantees like the National Housing Law Project and North Carolina Tenants Union, but focused specifically on Denver's municipal context.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how Denver For All's work aligns with FHO's funding priorities.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
Denver For All
