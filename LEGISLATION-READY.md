# Denver For All -- Legislation Readiness Analysis

Which of our 45 proposals could be filed immediately as Denver ordinances, and which require state/federal action?

## Tier 1: File Tomorrow (City Council Ordinance, Clear Legal Authority)

These proposals can be introduced as Denver city ordinances with minimal legal risk:

### 1. Medical Debt Forgiveness Program

- **Mechanism:** City appropriation to purchase and cancel medical debt
- **Legal basis:** Standard city spending authority
- **Precedent:** Toledo, New Orleans, Chicago, and others have done this through Undue Medical Debt partnerships
- **Cost:** $5M appropriation can forgive $100-500M in debt
- **Political risk:** Very low. Hard to argue against forgiving medical debt.
- **Draft target:** Single appropriation ordinance + ongoing program creation

### 2. Municipal ID Program (Denver ID)

- **Mechanism:** City ordinance creating an ID program for all residents
- **Legal basis:** Denver's home rule authority over city services
- **Precedent:** IDNYC (New York City, 1.3M+ IDs issued), San Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles
- **Cost:** $2M startup, $500K/year (offset by $15 ID fee)
- **Political risk:** Low-moderate. Frame as public safety tool (people can identify themselves to police, access services).

### 3. STAR Program Expansion

- **Mechanism:** Budget amendment increasing STAR funding + operational expansion
- **Legal basis:** City budget authority; program already exists
- **Precedent:** STAR has operated citywide since 2022 with over 23,000 van responses. A 2026 Urban Institute evaluation found 16% reductions in subsequent arrests and police contacts, with 2-3x larger impacts for people experiencing homelessness. Urban Institute analysis shows 9-10 concurrent van units needed to meet full demand (currently 6-7 units serving 45% of eligible calls).
- **Cost:** Increase from ~$4.4M to $20M (full program at current demand scale: ~$8.6M per Urban Institute; $20M target accounts for 24/7 coverage and expanded capacity beyond current demand, partially redirected from police overtime)
- **Political risk:** Moderate. Police union will object to budget shift, but program's outcomes are now backed by rigorous independent evaluation showing proven reductions in criminal justice involvement.

### 4. Hospital Cost Transparency Strengthening

- **Mechanism:** City ordinance with stronger enforcement of existing state transparency law
- **Legal basis:** Denver home rule + existing Colorado HB 2019-1285
- **Cost:** Minimal (enforcement staff)
- **Political risk:** Low. Transparency is hard to argue against.

### 5. Participatory Budgeting Pilot

- **Mechanism:** Council resolution allocating 2-5% of capital budget to PB for a pilot year
- **Legal basis:** Council's existing budget authority
- **Precedent:** NYC does $40M+/year; Paris does 500M euros
- **Cost:** $2-3M administration for $50-100M allocation
- **Political risk:** Low. Start with a pilot; scale based on results.

### 6. Anti-Retaliation Protections for Tenants

- **Mechanism:** City ordinance strengthening existing Colorado anti-retaliation law with local enforcement
- **Legal basis:** Home rule authority over landlord-tenant relations (within state law framework)
- **Cost:** $1-2M for enforcement office
- **Political risk:** Low-moderate. Popular with renters (50%+ of Denver residents).

### 7. Source-of-Income Discrimination Ban

- **Mechanism:** Amend Denver's anti-discrimination ordinance to include source of income
- **Legal basis:** Denver's existing human rights ordinance; multiple Colorado cities have done this
- **Precedent:** Colorado passed statewide source-of-income protection in 2024
- **Cost:** Enforcement through existing city agency
- **Political risk:** Very low (state already passed this).

### 8. Right to Disconnect for City Employees

- **Mechanism:** Executive order or city personnel policy
- **Legal basis:** Mayor/city manager authority over employee policies
- **Cost:** Zero
- **Political risk:** Very low. Popular with workers. Costs nothing. Demonstrates the model.

### 9. 32-Hour Work Week for City Employees (Pilot)

- **Mechanism:** Executive order or council resolution for 6-month pilot
- **Legal basis:** City authority over its own workforce
- **Precedent:** UK 4-day week pilot (92% of companies continued permanently)
- **Cost:** Zero net (productivity maintained per evidence from all major trials)
- **Political risk:** Low. Pilot framing reduces risk. If it works, expand. If it doesn't, revert.

### 10. Vacancy Registry

- **Mechanism:** Ordinance requiring annual registration of vacant residential properties
- **Legal basis:** City regulatory authority (building/housing code enforcement)
- **Cost:** Minimal (registration fees cover administration)
- **Political risk:** Low. This is data collection, not a tax (the tax comes later, at the ballot).
- **Strategic value:** Builds the data infrastructure needed for a vacancy tax ballot measure.

## Tier 2: Requires Ballot Measure (TABOR)

These proposals involve new taxes or revenue and require Denver voter approval under TABOR:

### 11. Vacancy Tax

- **Requires:** Denver ballot measure (TABOR voter approval for new tax)
- **Timeline:** File for November 2026 ballot
- **Polling:** Housing crisis measures tend to poll well. Vancouver's passed easily.
- **Strategic:** Pass the vacancy registry (Tier 1) first to build data for the ballot campaign.

### 12. Social Housing Authority Funding (Revenue Bonds)

- **Requires:** Voter approval for bonding authority
- **Timeline:** Can pair with vacancy tax on same ballot
- **Political case:** Frame as "your money, your housing" vs. "your money, developer profits"

## Tier 3: Requires State Legislation

These proposals require action by the Colorado General Assembly:

### 13. Rent Stabilization

- **Blocked by:** CRS 38-12-301 (state preemption of local rent control)
- **Path:** State bill to repeal preemption OR state ballot initiative
- **Coalition:** Build with other Colorado cities (Boulder, Aurora, Colorado Springs have renters who would benefit)
- **Denver's role:** Pass a "trigger" ordinance that takes effect the moment state preemption is lifted. This demonstrates demand and commitment.

### 14. Sectoral Bargaining (Full Implementation)

- **Partially blocked by:** NLRA federal preemption of labor relations law
- **What Denver CAN do now:** City contractor wage boards (Tier 1 authority), voluntary framework with tax incentives
- **State path:** Colorado legislation enabling municipal wage boards
- **Federal path:** PRO Act or similar federal legislation

### 15. Works Councils (Private Sector)

- **Blocked by:** NLRA federal preemption
- **What Denver CAN do now:** City employee works councils (Tier 1), contractor requirements (Tier 1), voluntary adoption incentives
- **State/federal path:** Long-term advocacy for enabling legislation

### 16. Corporate Landlord Acquisition Ban

- **Legal complexity:** Potential Commerce Clause and takings clause challenges
- **Path:** Start with beneficial ownership transparency ordinance (Tier 1) and algorithmic pricing ban (strong antitrust basis). Phase in acquisition restrictions with careful legal drafting.

## Tier 4: Federal Dependency

### 17. Full Drug Decriminalization

- **Denver CAN:** Instruct city attorney not to prosecute personal possession (prosecutorial discretion). Establish safe consumption sites under home rule authority.
- **Denver CANNOT:** Override federal Controlled Substances Act
- **Path:** Use prosecutorial discretion now; advocate for state and federal reform

### 18. Immigration Enforcement Non-Cooperation

- **Denver CAN:** Strengthen existing sanctuary ordinance (Tier 1 -- already has authority, just needs to close gaps)
- **Legal basis:** 10th Amendment anti-commandeering (confirmed by federal courts)
- **Risk:** Federal funding threats (low actual risk per court precedent)
