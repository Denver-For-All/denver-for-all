## The Problem

Bodily autonomy — the right to make decisions about what happens to your own body — is under coordinated attack in the United States. Since the Supreme Court's *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* decision in 2022, which overturned *Roe v. Wade*, 21 states have banned or severely restricted abortion (Guttmacher Institute, 2026). The same political movement targeting abortion access is simultaneously targeting gender-affirming care for trans people, contraception access, and the right to make end-of-life decisions. These are not separate fights. They are the same fight: who controls your body — you, or the government?

Colorado is positioned as a national leader. In November 2024, voters approved **Amendment 79** with 61.6% support, enshrining the right to abortion in the Colorado Constitution and lifting the longstanding ban on public insurance coverage for abortion care. In 2025, the General Assembly passed **SB 25-183**, implementing Amendment 79 by expanding the definition of "family-planning-related services" under Medicaid to include abortion. As of January 1, 2026, abortion care is eligible for Medicaid reimbursement in Colorado for the first time.

But a constitutional right is not the same as access. As Cobalt, Colorado's leading reproductive rights advocacy organization, has warned: **"Our success is going to be measured by our outcomes, not our intent."** The threats to real-world access are immediate:

- **Reimbursement rates determine whether providers participate.** Under SB 25-183, Colorado Medicaid reimburses procedural abortions at approximately $1,300 and medication abortions at approximately $800. Whether these rates cover the true cost of care — including security, staffing, and administrative compliance — will determine provider participation. Cobalt's political director has warned that rates must "reflect the very real cost of care, staff, clinical time, follow up compliance infrastructure" or "Colorado risks creating a legal right that patients cannot practically use." Governor Polis has proposed budget adjustments that may limit provider rates to 85% of Medicare benchmarks. The same reimbursement crisis already limits doula participation under Medicaid (see [Maternal & Infant Health Equity](/platform/maternal-infant-health)).
- **Providers face elevated costs that reimbursement doesn't cover.** Colorado has 23 brick-and-mortar abortion clinics statewide — down from 42 in 2011 — despite an 88% increase in abortions over the same period (Guttmacher Institute, 2024). Sixty-five percent of Colorado providers reported trespassing at their clinics in 2023-2024, and 53% reported anti-abortion protesters (National Abortion Federation). Security costs, workforce shortages, and administrative complexity are burdens unique to reproductive healthcare providers. Low reimbursement in the face of these costs is a formula for clinic closure.
- **Colorado is absorbing out-of-state demand.** In 2023, approximately 30% of abortions performed in Colorado were for out-of-state patients — up from 12% in 2018 (CDPHE). Texas residents alone accounted for 67% of out-of-state patients, surging from 40 in 2019 to an estimated 2,800-4,400 in 2023 after Texas SB 8 and Dobbs. Wait times have risen significantly: first-trimester average waits are now 22 days (up from 12 pre-SB 8), and second-trimester waits average 41 days (up from 25) at Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains. Colorado residents' wait times also increased, adding 3 days on average.
- **Rural access is thin and getting thinner.** Outside the Denver-Boulder-Fort Collins corridor, abortion providers are scarce. The closest procedural abortion from Grand Junction on the Western Slope is over 200 miles away — a new clinic there hopes to open in late 2026. Rural Coloradans face hours of travel, missed work, childcare challenges, and accommodation costs. Amendment 79 does not solve geography.
- **Federal threats are escalating.** The FDA's review of mifepristone — used in approximately 63% of US abortions (Guttmacher Institute, 2023) — has been delayed until after the 2026 midterms. Louisiana has sued the FDA over mifepristone access rules, and Louisiana's attorney general has announced plans to sue New York and California to force extradition of doctors who mail abortion pills across state lines. The Trump administration has moved to pause the Louisiana lawsuit but echoed concerns about the FDA's 2023 rule easing mifepristone access. If mifepristone access is restricted at the federal level, the impact would be immediate and devastating — even in states like Colorado where abortion is constitutionally protected.
- **State budget constraints threaten implementation.** Colorado faces a significant budget gap caused in part by the federal government withdrawing support mid-budget cycle. Medicaid funding is vulnerable. Governor Polis has proposed budget adjustments that could affect provider rates. Organizations like Cobalt warn that the legislature will need to fight to protect reproductive healthcare funding in a constrained fiscal environment. Meanwhile, the federal HHS has proposed a regulation prohibiting insurers from treating "sex trait modification procedures" as an essential health benefit under the ACA — 21 states have filed suit, but if it stands, it could affect Colorado plan designs.
- **The opposition is not done.** Despite Amendment 79's 61.6% mandate, anti-abortion advocates have filed **Initiative 149 ("Right to Life From Conception")** for the 2026 ballot — a personhood measure that Colorado voters have rejected repeatedly (2008, 2010, 2014, 2020, 2022). Proponents need 124,328 signatures by August 3, 2026. Even if it fails again, the campaign diverts advocacy resources and generates confusion about the state of abortion law. Cobalt has defeated 51 anti-abortion bills since 2010. The fight for bodily autonomy is never finished.

### What Denver Currently Does

Denver has no standalone municipal reproductive healthcare protection strategy. The city relies entirely on state law (Amendment 79, SB 25-183, the Reproductive Health Equity Act of 2022) and the existing healthcare infrastructure:

- **Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains** operates 18 locations across the region, including multiple Denver metro clinics. PPRM is the largest reproductive healthcare provider in the region.
- **Denver Health** began offering elective abortions for the first time in its 163-year history in November 2023, providing both medication and procedural abortions (through 11 weeks, one day per week) at $500 each. This was a significant step for a public safety-net hospital serving a predominantly Medicaid population.
- **Independent clinics** (14 statewide) and **telehealth providers** (3 clinics) provide abortion services, including medication abortion. These providers are particularly vulnerable to the financial pressures of low reimbursement and high security costs.
- **The Cobalt Abortion Fund** provides direct financial assistance and coordinates with the broader network. In 2025, Cobalt provided in-procedure funding for an estimated 2,000+ clients and projects spending over $1 million annually. In early January 2026, the fund reported its first client able to use Colorado Medicaid to help cover abortion costs under the new Amendment 79 implementation.
- **Colorado's shield laws (SB 23-188 and SB 25-129)** provide comprehensive protection: providers can exclude their names from medication abortion labels; CDPHE is prohibited from collecting identifying patient information in induced termination reports; Colorado attorneys, law enforcement, hospitals, and insurers are blocked from complying with hostile out-of-state investigations; subpoena requestors must affirm they are not pursuing charges related to protected care; providers and staff may enroll in the state address confidentiality program; and the Attorney General has enforcement authority. SB 23-189 (2023) also requires commercial insurance to cover abortion and STI services without copays, deductibles, or coinsurance.
- **Colorado has no gestational limits** on abortion — one of only nine states. There are no mandatory waiting periods or mandatory counseling requirements. The Reproductive Health Equity Act (HB 22-1279) prohibits denying, restricting, or discriminating against the right to have an abortion.

What Denver lacks: any city-funded reproductive healthcare infrastructure, municipal-level provider protections beyond state law, a coordinated strategy for absorbing out-of-state patients, medication abortion access expansion, or data tracking on reproductive healthcare access, wait times, and provider participation.

## Who Opposes This (and Why)

**Anti-abortion advocacy organizations** will frame any expansion of abortion access as promoting abortion. In reality, this policy ensures that a constitutional right approved by 61.6% of Colorado voters can actually be exercised. Access is not promotion.

**Fiscal conservatives** will argue Denver cannot afford municipal reproductive healthcare spending. The evidence is clear: every dollar invested in reproductive healthcare access — including abortion, contraception, and prenatal care — reduces downstream costs in emergency room utilization, complicated pregnancies, NICU admissions, and public assistance. Unintended pregnancies carried to term cost the healthcare system and social services far more than reproductive healthcare prevention and intervention (Guttmacher Institute, 2015; Brookings Institution, 2016).

**Some religious institutions** will oppose on moral grounds. Denver For All respects religious freedom. No provider is compelled to perform abortions. But no institution's religious beliefs can override an individual's constitutional right to bodily autonomy. Amendment 79 was decided by voters, not theologians.

**The "Do Not Abort Form" bill (HB26-1085)** in the 2026 legislative session represents the legislative strategy of imposing administrative barriers to abortion access. These bills do not ban abortion — they create paperwork, waiting periods, and bureaucratic friction designed to delay and discourage. Denver's role is to ensure that state-level administrative barriers do not compound into denied access for residents.

## Our Solution

### 1. Bodily Autonomy as a Governing Principle

Bodily autonomy — the right to make decisions about your own body without coercion — is the through-line connecting reproductive healthcare, gender-affirming care, disability rights, and end-of-life decisions. Denver should adopt bodily autonomy as an explicit governing principle in health policy.

- **Municipal resolution** declaring Denver's commitment to bodily autonomy as a public health imperative, encompassing reproductive healthcare, gender-affirming care (cross-reference: [LGBTQ+ Sanctuary & Protection](/platform/lgbtq-sanctuary)), disability rights to bodily integrity (cross-reference: [Disability Rights & Inclusion](/platform/disability-rights)), and informed consent as the standard for all healthcare decisions
- **Non-cooperation directive**: Denver city employees, including Denver Health staff, will not cooperate with any federal, state, or interstate enforcement action that criminalizes healthcare decisions protected under Colorado law — whether abortion, gender-affirming care, or other constitutionally protected medical treatment
- This is not a symbolic gesture. It is a legal and operational framework. Cross-reference: [Immigration Sanctuary](/platform/immigration-sanctuary) for the model of municipal non-cooperation with federal overreach

### 2. Reproductive Healthcare Provider Sustainability Fund

The constitutional right to abortion means nothing if there are no providers. Colorado's Amendment 79 implementation depends entirely on whether clinics can afford to participate in Medicaid.

- **City-funded provider sustainability grants** for Denver-based abortion providers to offset costs that Medicaid reimbursement does not cover: security infrastructure (cameras, access control, threat assessment), workforce recruitment and retention bonuses, administrative compliance costs, and facility maintenance
- **Advocacy for adequate state reimbursement rates**: Denver formally advocates to the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing for abortion care reimbursement rates that reflect the true cost of service delivery — including the elevated security and administrative costs unique to reproductive healthcare. Reimbursement must be sufficient for providers to sustain Medicaid participation without financial loss
- **Provider recruitment and retention**: Denver actively recruits reproductive healthcare providers — physicians, advanced practice clinicians, and clinic staff — displaced from hostile states. Relocation assistance, streamlined credentialing, and integration with Denver Health and FQHCs. Cross-reference: the same approach we propose for trans healthcare providers in [LGBTQ+ Sanctuary & Protection](/platform/lgbtq-sanctuary)
- **Clinic security fund**: direct city funding for physical security at Denver reproductive healthcare clinics. Security costs are a unique burden that reproductive healthcare providers bear and that other medical facilities do not. Buffer zone enforcement (already proposed in [Healthcare as a Right](/platform/healthcare)) is complemented by tangible security support

### 3. Medication Abortion Access Expansion

Medication abortion (mifepristone and misoprostol) accounts for approximately 63% of US abortions and is safe, effective, and the preferred method for most early pregnancies (Guttmacher Institute, 2023). Federal threats to mifepristone access make local preparedness essential.

- **Telehealth medication abortion** through Denver Health and FQHCs: expand availability of medication abortion via telehealth for Denver residents, reducing the need for in-person clinic visits. Colorado law already permits telehealth prescribing for medication abortion. Denver ensures its public health system actively offers this service
- **Pharmacy access**: work with Denver-area pharmacies to ensure mifepristone is stocked and available for dispensing. Federal rule changes in 2023 allowed retail pharmacies to dispense mifepristone with proper certification. Denver tracks pharmacy participation and addresses gaps
- **Mifepristone contingency planning**: if federal action restricts mifepristone access, Denver prepares contingency protocols using misoprostol-only regimens (which are effective, though slightly less so than the combination regimen, and are not subject to the same FDA restrictions). Denver Health develops and maintains these protocols in advance, not in crisis
- **Contraception access**: ensure all Denver Health facilities and FQHCs provide same-day access to the full range of contraceptive methods, including long-acting reversible contraception (LARCs), without cost barriers for uninsured or underinsured patients. Prevention is the first line of reproductive healthcare

### 4. Denver as a Reproductive Healthcare Destination

Colorado is one of the closest states with full abortion access for millions of people in states with bans. Denver must plan for this role rather than absorb demand reactively.

- **Out-of-state patient coordination**: Denver works with Planned Parenthood, independent clinics, and abortion funds to coordinate capacity for out-of-state patients, including appointment availability tracking, travel logistics support, and accommodation referrals
- **Practical support fund**: city contribution to a fund providing travel, lodging, childcare, and lost wages for patients traveling to Denver for reproductive healthcare — particularly from neighboring ban states. This supplements existing abortion fund work by organizations like the Cobalt Abortion Fund and National Abortion Federation
- **Legal protection for patients**: Denver's non-cooperation directive explicitly protects the medical records and personal information of out-of-state patients from subpoena, discovery, or disclosure to law enforcement in states where abortion is criminalized. Colorado's shield law provides the state-level framework; Denver adds municipal enforcement
- **Provider capacity planning**: Denver tracks patient volume, wait times, and capacity at reproductive healthcare facilities to identify when demand exceeds supply and trigger expansion. No patient — in-state or out-of-state — should face clinically significant delays for time-sensitive care

### 5. Reproductive Healthcare for Trans and Nonbinary People

Reproductive healthcare is not only a cisgender women's issue. Trans men, nonbinary people, and other gender-diverse individuals also need contraception, pregnancy care, abortion access, fertility services, and gynecological care. The healthcare system largely fails them.

- **Gender-affirming reproductive healthcare** at Denver Health and all FQHCs: reproductive healthcare services explicitly inclusive of trans and nonbinary patients, with staff trained in gender-affirming care, intake forms that use correct names and pronouns, and clinical protocols that account for the effects of hormone therapy on reproductive health
- **Reproductive counseling for people on HRT**: patients on testosterone or estrogen should receive accurate, non-judgmental counseling about fertility, contraception, and pregnancy options. Testosterone is not a contraceptive, and pregnancies on testosterone occur — yet many trans patients receive no reproductive health counseling from their providers
- **Removal of gendered barriers**: ensure that reproductive healthcare access does not depend on gender markers. A patient should not be denied a Pap smear, contraception, or abortion because their ID says "M." Denver Health and FQHC intake systems are updated to decouple reproductive services from gender classification
- **Connection to the bodily autonomy framework**: the same political movement restricting abortion access is restricting gender-affirming care. Denver recognizes that reproductive autonomy and gender autonomy are inseparable — both are about the fundamental right to make decisions about your own body. Policies protecting one must protect both. Cross-reference: [LGBTQ+ Sanctuary & Protection](/platform/lgbtq-sanctuary)

### 6. Reproductive Healthcare Data Transparency

You cannot defend what you do not measure. Denver has no public data on reproductive healthcare access.

- **Reproductive healthcare access dashboard**: publicly available data on provider availability, wait times, Medicaid participation rates, patient volume (in-state and out-of-state), and service types (medication abortion, procedural abortion, contraception, prenatal care)
- **Provider participation tracking**: monitor how many Denver providers accept Medicaid for abortion care under the new Amendment 79 implementation. If participation declines — the risk Cobalt has identified — the city has early warning to intervene with sustainability funding or advocacy
- **Geographic access mapping**: identify reproductive healthcare deserts within Denver and surrounding metro areas. Map travel distances to nearest provider by neighborhood, with particular attention to underserved communities
- **Annual Reproductive Healthcare Access Report** published by DDPHE, tracking progress against access goals and identifying emerging threats. Cross-reference: the birth equity dashboard proposed in [Maternal & Infant Health Equity](/platform/maternal-infant-health)

### International Evidence: Bodily Autonomy as Policy

| Country | Model | Result |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **France** | Abortion fully covered by national health insurance since 2013. No waiting period. Available up to 14 weeks (extended from 12 in 2022). Medication abortion available via telehealth. | Abortion rate stable (not increased by coverage). Near-universal access. No provider shortage because reimbursement covers costs. |
| **Canada** | Abortion decriminalized since 1988. No gestational limits in federal law. Covered by all provincial health plans. Mifepristone approved 2017 and covered by public insurance. | Access challenges remain in rural areas and some provinces, but urban access is robust. No political movement to recriminalize — settled law. |
| **New Zealand** | Abortion removed from criminal law in 2020. Available on request up to 20 weeks. Fully funded by public health system. Telehealth medication abortion expanded during COVID. | Treated as routine healthcare. Provider participation is high because the system does not stigmatize the service. |
| **Uruguay** | Legalized abortion in 2012 in a socially conservative country. Free in public health system. Requires counseling (with 5-day reflection period — criticized by advocates). | Abortion-related maternal mortality dropped to near zero. Safe access replaced dangerous clandestine procedures. Demonstrates that even in conservative contexts, legal access saves lives. |
| **Ireland** | Legalized abortion by referendum in 2018 (66.4% — similar to Colorado's 61.6%). Implemented through Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018. Free through public health system up to 12 weeks. | Implementation challenges: GP participation lower than expected in some regions due to opt-out provisions. Ireland's experience is directly relevant to Colorado — a voter mandate does not automatically produce access. Provider participation and geographic coverage require active policy support. |
| **United States** | Post-Dobbs patchwork. 21 states with bans or severe restrictions. Remaining states absorbing displaced demand. No federal insurance coverage (Hyde Amendment). | Colorado is one of the most protective states. But protection without infrastructure is a paper right. The US is the only wealthy democracy where reproductive healthcare access depends on which state you live in. |

The lesson from Ireland is particularly relevant: a strong voter mandate (66.4% in favor) did not automatically produce provider participation. Active government support — adequate reimbursement, provider recruitment, geographic access planning — was necessary to turn a constitutional right into a functioning system. Colorado faces the same challenge.

## How We Pay For It

- **Provider sustainability fund** (grants, security, recruitment): $3-5M/year. Offset: every clinic that closes due to financial unsustainability costs the system far more in emergency room utilization, delayed care complications, and out-of-state travel for patients
- **Medication abortion expansion** (telehealth, pharmacy coordination, contingency planning): $500K-1M/year. Medication abortion costs $300-800 per patient versus $800-3,000+ for procedural abortion — expanding medication access reduces system costs
- **Reproductive healthcare destination coordination** (patient support, capacity planning): $1-2M/year. Offset through state and federal family planning funding (Title X), abortion fund partnerships, and reduced emergency utilization
- **Trans and nonbinary reproductive healthcare** (staff training, system updates, clinical protocols): $300-500K/year. Integrated into existing FQHC and Denver Health budgets
- **Data transparency** (dashboard, annual report, provider tracking): $300-500K/year
- **Total: ~$5-9M/year**, a fraction of the healthcare budget and a fraction of the cost of NOT ensuring access. For context: the state fiscal analysis of SB 25-183 found that $5.9 million in abortion services costs would be offset by $6.4 million in averted birth costs — a net savings of $550,000 annually at the state level alone. Unintended pregnancies cost the US healthcare system an estimated $21 billion annually (Guttmacher Institute, 2015). For every $1 invested in publicly funded contraceptive services, $7.09 is saved in pregnancy-related costs (Guttmacher, 2015). Reproductive healthcare is among the highest-return public health investments available.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Amendment 79 already protects abortion in Colorado. Why does Denver need its own policy?"**
Amendment 79 establishes the constitutional right and lifts the insurance coverage ban. It does not fund providers, stock pharmacies, recruit clinicians, protect out-of-state patients at the municipal level, plan for federal threats, or ensure that trans and nonbinary people can access reproductive healthcare without discrimination. A right without infrastructure is a right on paper. Denver's role is to make the right real — and to be the last line of defense if state or federal policy shifts.

**"This is just about abortion."**
This is about bodily autonomy — the right to make decisions about your own body. That includes abortion, contraception, pregnancy care, gender-affirming care, fertility services, and the right to carry a pregnancy to term with dignity and support (see [Maternal & Infant Health Equity](/platform/maternal-infant-health)). The political attack on these rights is coordinated. Our defense must be equally comprehensive.

**"Won't this make Denver a magnet for out-of-state abortion patients?"**
Denver is already a destination for out-of-state patients — that is a consequence of other states' bans, not Denver's policy. The question is whether we plan for this role responsibly or let demand overwhelm our system. Planned coordination protects both Denver residents' access and the out-of-state patients who need help.

**"Abortion coverage increases abortion rates."**
International evidence consistently shows that public funding for abortion does not increase abortion rates — it shifts abortions from unsafe, later, and more costly to safe, earlier, and less costly. France has fully covered abortion since 2013 with no increase in abortion rates. Countries with the lowest abortion rates in the world (Western Europe) are countries with the most accessible abortion services and the best contraception access. Countries with the highest abortion rates (Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa) are countries with the most restrictive laws. Restriction does not reduce abortion. It makes abortion dangerous.

**"Why include trans healthcare in a reproductive healthcare policy?"**
Because the same political movement attacking abortion access is attacking gender-affirming care. Both are rooted in the same principle: the government should not control your body. And practically, trans men and nonbinary people need reproductive healthcare — contraception, pregnancy care, abortion access — and the healthcare system routinely fails them. A reproductive healthcare policy that only serves cisgender women is incomplete.

**"Denver can't protect against federal action on mifepristone."**
Not entirely, but Denver can prepare. Contingency protocols using misoprostol-only regimens, stockpiling where legally permissible, telehealth expansion, and advocacy all reduce the impact of potential federal restrictions. California and other states have already begun stockpiling mifepristone. Denver can join them and coordinate with the state.
