Translate the following JSON containing policy titles, summaries, and key statistics for the Denver For All civic platform. These appear as card headlines and preview text throughout the site.

Return a valid JSON object with the EXACT SAME structure and keys. Translate only the string values for "title", "summary", "label", "context", and "source" fields within each policy. Do NOT translate:
- JSON keys (slug names like "housing-first", field names like "title")
- The "value" field in keyStats (these are numbers/statistics)
- Organization names, bill numbers, or proper nouns within source citations

Guidelines:
- Policy titles should be compelling and concise
- Summaries should maintain the persuasive, direct tone of the English originals
- keyStats labels and context should be clear and factual
- Source citations: translate descriptive text but keep organization names and years as-is

Output ONLY the JSON — no markdown code fences, no explanation.
