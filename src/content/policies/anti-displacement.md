## The Problem

Every time Denver builds a new transit station, nearby rents spike, longtime residents are displaced, and the people the transit was supposed to serve can no longer afford to live near it. This pattern — build transit, gentrify neighborhood, displace residents — is a policy choice, not an inevitability.

The same happens with major development projects, rezoning, and "revitalization" efforts. The benefits flow to developers and new arrivals. The costs fall on existing residents.

## Our Solution

### Anti-Displacement Zone Ordinance

**Designated zones:** 1-mile radius around all current and planned RTD light rail and bus rapid transit stations, plus areas targeted for major rezoning or development.

**Protections within zones:**

1. **Mandatory Inclusionary Zoning:** All new residential construction of 10+ units must include 30% affordable units (at 50% AMI) — on-site, not fee-in-lieu.

2. **No Net Loss:** Any demolition or conversion of existing affordable housing must be replaced 1:1 within the same zone before or concurrent with the new development.

3. **Existing Tenant Protection:** Tenants in buildings undergoing renovation, sale, or demolition have:
   - 180-day advance notice
   - Relocation assistance (3 months rent)
   - Right of return at their pre-displacement rent

4. **Community Benefit Agreements (CBAs):** Any development over $10M within an anti-displacement zone requires a binding CBA negotiated with a recognized community organization. CBAs must include local hiring requirements, affordable commercial space for existing small businesses, and contributions to the community land trust.

5. **Small Business Protection:** Commercial tenants in zones are covered by commercial rent stabilization. No more displacing the taqueria to build a fusion restaurant.

6. **Community Land Trust Priority:** CLTs have right of first purchase for any residential property listed for sale within anti-displacement zones.

## How We Pay For It

Primarily regulatory (minimal direct cost). CBA requirements are funded by developers as a condition of building permits. Enforcement: $1-2M/year from development impact fees.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Won't this stop development?"**
No. It ensures development benefits existing residents instead of displacing them. Developers can still build — they just have to build inclusively. If a project isn't viable with 30% affordable units, it was never viable — it was just subsidized by displacement.

**"Isn't 30% inclusionary too high?"**
Cities like Montreal, Barcelona, and several jurisdictions in the US have implemented 20-30% inclusionary requirements successfully. The key is that it applies to everyone equally — no competitive disadvantage.
