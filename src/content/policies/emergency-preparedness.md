## The Problem

Denver faces escalating climate-driven emergencies. Wildfire smoke from fires across Colorado and the western US regularly blankets the metro area. Denver experienced over 20 days with unhealthy air quality in 2023 alone (Colorado DPHE Air Quality Control Commission). The Marshall Fire in December 2021, which destroyed over 1,000 homes in Boulder County just 20 miles from Denver, demonstrated that wildfire is not an abstract mountain risk but an immediate Front Range reality. Smoke events are becoming longer and more intense, and Denver has no comprehensive smoke response plan.

Extreme heat is accelerating. Denver set its all-time record high of 105°F in June 2024, and the city averages 20+ days above 95°F per year, a figure projected to more than double by 2050 (Denver Climate Action Task Force). Urban heat islands in neighborhoods like Globeville-Elyria-Swansea, Sun Valley, and Westwood push temperatures 10-15°F above tree-canopied areas (Trust for Public Land, 2023). Heat is the deadliest weather event in the United States, killing more people annually than hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods combined. Colorado reported 89 heat-related deaths in 2023 (Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment). Low-income residents, elderly residents, outdoor workers, and people experiencing homelessness bear the worst consequences.

Denver also faces flash flood risk from aging stormwater infrastructure that was not designed for increasingly intense rainfall events. The city's combined sewer system serves older neighborhoods and can overflow during heavy rain, sending untreated sewage into waterways. Power grid reliability during extreme weather is an ongoing concern: the December 2022 winter storm caused rolling outages across Colorado. And when emergencies hit, low-income neighborhoods and communities of color consistently experience slower response, fewer resources, and more displacement.

### What Denver Currently Does

Denver's Office of Emergency Management (OEM) coordinates disaster planning and response. The city maintains a network of cooling centers at recreation centers and libraries during heat advisories, but they are limited in number, hours, and accessibility: most close at 5 PM when evening heat remains dangerous. Denver participates in the National Weather Service heat advisory system and issues public notifications.

Denver's 80x50 Climate Action Plan (2018) includes some adaptation planning but is primarily focused on emissions reduction, not emergency preparedness. The city has invested in stormwater infrastructure through the Storm Drainage Fund, which collects approximately $115M annually. Denver adopted green infrastructure standards for new development and has piloted bioswale and rain garden projects along the Platte River corridor.

FEMA rates Denver County at "relatively moderate" risk for natural hazards. The city's hazard mitigation plan was last updated in 2023. However, climate change is accelerating risks faster than planning documents are updated, and existing plans do not adequately address equity in disaster response.

## Our Solution

- Free N95 masks distributed through libraries, rec centers, and fire stations during smoke events
- Real-time air quality monitoring network with sensors in every neighborhood and a public dashboard
- Automatic school and outdoor activity protocols triggered by AQI thresholds
- Vulnerable population registry: proactive outreach to elderly, respiratory patients, and outdoor workers during smoke events
- Indoor air quality support: HEPA filter lending library and subsidized units for low-income households

### 2. Extreme Heat Action Plan
- Cooling centers in every neighborhood with extended hours during heat events (open until 10 PM minimum)
- Misting stations and shade structures at transit stops, parks, and public spaces
- Urban tree canopy acceleration to 30% coverage target (cross-reference climate policy)
- Cool roof and cool pavement requirements for new construction and city facilities
- Heat vulnerability mapping: identify and invest in highest-risk neighborhoods first
- Mandatory rest breaks and water access for outdoor workers during heat advisories (cross-reference labor policies)
- Mobile cooling units deployed to encampments and neighborhoods without nearby cooling centers

### 3. Flood & Stormwater Resilience
- Green stormwater infrastructure: bioswales, rain gardens, and permeable pavement in flood-prone areas
- Stormwater detention expansion prioritizing underserved neighborhoods
- Real-time flood monitoring and early warning system for all Denver waterways
- Creek and waterway restoration to reduce channelization and increase natural flood buffers
- Residential flood preparedness: free sandbag access and sump pump assistance for low-income homes
- Combined sewer overflow elimination plan with dedicated timeline and public reporting

### 4. Community Resilience Hubs
- Solar-powered, battery-backed community centers in every council district that function during power outages (cross-reference: [Power Reliability & Municipal Energy](/platform/power-reliability) for our full grid resilience and municipal power proposal)
- Equipped with backup power, water, first aid supplies, communications, heating/cooling, and phone charging
- Staffed by trained Community Emergency Response Teams (CERT)
- Dual-use: serve as community gathering spaces normally, emergency centers during crises
- Modeled on Portland and Baltimore resilience hub programs
- Located in the neighborhoods most vulnerable to climate impacts

### 5. Equitable Disaster Response
- Equity-centered emergency planning: prioritize neighborhoods with highest social vulnerability scores
- Multilingual emergency communications (Spanish, Vietnamese, Amharic, Arabic, Somali)
- Disability-accessible shelters and evacuation plans with ADA-exceeding standards
- Emergency services available regardless of immigration status (cross-reference sanctuary policy)
- Post-disaster anti-displacement protections: rent freeze, eviction moratorium, and streamlined aid access after declared emergencies
- CERT training in every neighborhood, free and multilingual, with childcare provided

### International Evidence: Preparedness Saves Lives and Money

| Country/City | Model | Result |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| **Tokyo, Japan** | Comprehensive disaster preparedness: neighborhood emergency committees, regular community drills, seismic-resilient infrastructure, 3-day supply kits for every household. | Lowest death rates from natural disasters of any major city despite extreme earthquake and typhoon exposure. Community-based preparation is the foundation. |
| **Netherlands** | "Room for the River" program: instead of building higher levees, gave rivers space to flood safely through controlled floodplains and green infrastructure. | Transformed flood management for a country where 60% of land is flood-prone. Reduced flood risk while creating parks and recreation areas. |
| **Melbourne, Australia** | Urban forest strategy and cool routes program: mapped heat-vulnerable populations, planted 3,000 trees/year, created shaded walking routes to cooling centers. | Reduced urban temperatures measurably. Heat-health warning system cut heat-related hospital admissions by 30%. |
| **Medellín, Colombia** | Green corridors along major roads and waterways: 30 corridors reducing urban temperatures by 2°C. Integrated with early warning systems for landslides and flooding. | Combined climate adaptation with urban renewal. Reduced flood deaths through community-based early warning. |
| **Portland, OR** | Community resilience hubs: solar-powered, battery-backed neighborhood centers serving as emergency shelters and everyday community spaces. | Hubs served communities during 2021 heat dome (116°F) when hundreds died across Pacific Northwest. Proved the model works under extreme conditions. |

Every $1 invested in disaster preparedness saves $6 in disaster response and recovery costs (FEMA/National Institute of Building Sciences, 2019). Denver will pay for climate impacts one way or another. The question is whether we invest proactively and save lives, or pay reactively after people die.

## How We Pay For It

- Clean air shelters and smoke response: $3-5M/year (infrastructure + operations)
- Extreme heat plan: $5-8M/year (cooling infrastructure, shade structures, tree planting)
- Green stormwater infrastructure: $10-15M/year (capital investment, with federal grant opportunities through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act)
- Resilience hubs (11): $15-20M capital (phased over 4 years), $3-5M/year operations
- CERT training and community preparedness: $1-2M/year
- Total: $25-35M/year, with significant cost avoidance from reduced emergency response, healthcare, and property damage costs
- Federal funding: FEMA BRIC grants, EPA climate adaptation grants, and IIJA funding available for much of this work

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Denver doesn't have wildfires."**
Denver has wildfire smoke: 20+ poor air quality days in 2023 and increasing. The Marshall Fire burned 1,000 homes 20 miles from Denver. Climate change is making both smoke events and fire risk worse every year. These are documented trends, not projections.

**"Cooling centers already exist."**
Current cooling centers are too few, in inconvenient locations, and close too early. If a cooling center closes at 5 PM and it's still 100°F at 8 PM, it's not serving the people who need it. Our plan ensures coverage in every neighborhood with hours that match the actual heat risk.

**"This is too expensive."**
Portland's resilience hubs cost approximately $1-2M each and served communities during the 2021 heat dome that killed hundreds across the Pacific Northwest. The cost of not being prepared is measured in lives. FEMA data shows $1 in preparedness saves $6 in response, making this one of the highest-return public investments a city can make.

**"Isn't emergency management the state's job?"**
Cities are first responders. Denver OEM exists precisely because emergency preparedness is a local responsibility. The city controls cooling center hours, stormwater infrastructure, building codes, and community programming. State and federal agencies support but do not replace local preparedness.

**"Climate change is too big for a city to address."**
This policy is about adaptation and preparedness, not stopping climate change. Whether or not you believe in climate policy, the heat waves, smoke, and floods are already happening. Preparedness is common sense, not ideology.
