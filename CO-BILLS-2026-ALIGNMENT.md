# Colorado 2026 General Assembly Bills -- Alignment with Denver For All

Analysis of the 75th General Assembly (2026 Regular Session) bills for alignment with Denver For All's 48 policy proposals. Bills are organized by strategic priority.

---

## CRITICAL: Bills That Directly Enable Our Blocked Proposals

These bills address Tier 3 barriers identified in [LEGISLATION-READY.md](./LEGISLATION-READY.md) -- proposals currently blocked by state law. If these pass, they unlock Denver-level action.

### HB26-1036 -- Local Taxes on Vacant Residential Property
- **Status:** Introduced, assigned to Finance
- **What it does:** Authorizes local governments to impose excise taxes on vacant residential properties and allows local income taxes on certain entities
- **Why it matters:** This directly enables our **Vacancy Tax (Policy #6)** ballot measure. Currently Denver needs state authorization. If this passes, it clears the legal path for our November 2026 ballot initiative.
- **Our policy:** Vacancy Tax -- revenue generation for housing funds
- **Action:** High-priority support. Coordinate with sponsors (Rep. Titone, Rep. Velasco). Prepare testimony. This is the single most important bill for our housing agenda's near-term timeline.

### HB26-1005 -- Worker Protection Collective Bargaining
- **Status:** Referred from Business Affairs & Labor to Finance (unamended)
- **Sponsors:** Rep. Mabrey, Rep. Bacon, Sen. Danielson, Sen. Jodeh
- **What it does:** Reduces barriers in the "Labor Peace Act" to promote good faith collective bargaining
- **Why it matters:** Directly supports our **Sectoral Bargaining & Wage Boards (Policy #11)** and **Works Councils (Policy #12)** goals. Our LEGISLATION-READY.md identifies federal NLRA preemption and state law as barriers -- this bill chips away at state-level obstacles.
- **Action:** Strong support. Connect with sponsor network. This advances our entire labor platform.

### SB26-047 -- Colorado Firefighter Safety Act Petition Elections
- **Status:** Introduced, assigned to State, Veterans, & Military Affairs
- **What it does:** Changes election definitions to enable firefighter collective bargaining votes
- **Why it matters:** Expands collective bargaining infrastructure at the state level, supports our broader labor organizing goals
- **Action:** Support. Reinforces the collective bargaining framework we need.

### HB26-1119 -- Authority for Different Mill Levy Rates
- **Status:** Introduced, assigned to Finance
- **Sponsors:** Rep. Woodrow, Sen. Hinrichsen
- **What it does:** Allows local taxing entities to impose property taxes on land vs. improvements at different rates
- **Why it matters:** This enables **split-rate/land value taxation** -- a foundational tool for our **Fiscal Reform & Progressive Taxation (Policy #36)** and anti-speculation goals. Taxing land higher than improvements discourages vacant lot speculation and encourages development.
- **Action:** Support. Aligns with progressive taxation framework and anti-vacancy strategy.

## TOP 10 STRATEGIC PRIORITIES
