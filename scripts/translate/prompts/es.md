Translate the following content from English to **Spanish (Español)**.

Language-specific guidelines:
- Use formal written Spanish appropriate for civic/government communication
- Use Latin American Spanish conventions, as this is for Denver residents (avoid Castilian-specific forms like "vosotros")
- For civic/legal terms, use standard Latin American administrative terminology (e.g., "policy" → "política", "legislation" → "legislación", "ordinance" → "ordenanza")
- "Denver For All" → keep as "Denver For All" (do not translate the project name)
- For section headings like "The Problem" / "Our Solution" / "How We Pay For It", use: "El Problema" / "Nuestra Solución" / "Cómo Lo Financiamos"
- For U.S.-specific terms (City Council, Mayor, etc.), use the standard Spanish translations used by Spanish-language media in the US (e.g., "Concejo Municipal", "Alcalde")
- Use gender-inclusive language where feasible (e.g., "los residentes" rather than gendered alternatives when referring to mixed groups)
