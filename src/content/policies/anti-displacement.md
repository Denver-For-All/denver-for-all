## The Problem

Every time Denver builds a new transit station, nearby rents spike, longtime residents are displaced, and the people the transit was supposed to serve can no longer afford to live near it. This pattern - build transit, gentrify neighborhood, displace residents - is a policy choice, not an inevitability.

The same happens with major development projects, rezoning, and "revitalization" efforts. The benefits flow to developers and new arrivals. The costs fall on existing residents.

### What Denver Currently Does

Denver has limited anti-displacement tools. The Expanding Housing Affordability (EHA) ordinance requires 8-15% affordable units (depending on area) in new developments -- well below the 30% our proposal mandates. RTD transit-oriented development (TOD) guidelines are voluntary, not mandatory. Neighborhoods like RiNo, the 38th and Blake corridor, and areas near the University of Colorado A Line stations have seen dramatic rent increases and resident displacement following transit investment.

A 2019 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia found that Denver light rail expansion was associated with significant rent increases within one-half mile of new stations, with displacement concentrated among lower-income residents and communities of color. The pattern is clear and documented: Denver builds transit, and the people it was meant to serve can no longer afford to live near it.

## Our Solution

### Anti-Displacement Zone Ordinance

**Designated zones:** 1-mile radius around all current and planned RTD light rail and bus rapid transit stations, plus areas targeted for major rezoning or development.

**Protections within zones:**

1. **Mandatory Inclusionary Zoning:** All new residential construction of 10+ units must include 30% affordable units (at 50% AMI) - on-site, not fee-in-lieu.

2. **No Net Loss:** Any demolition or conversion of existing affordable housing must be replaced 1:1 within the same zone before or concurrent with the new development.

3. **Existing Tenant Protection:** Tenants in buildings undergoing renovation, sale, or demolition have:
   - 180-day advance notice
   - Relocation assistance (3 months rent)
   - Right of return at their pre-displacement rent

4. **Community Benefit Agreements (CBAs):** Any development over $10M within an anti-displacement zone requires a binding CBA negotiated with a recognized community organization. CBAs must include local hiring requirements, affordable commercial space for existing small businesses, and contributions to the community land trust.

5. **Small Business Protection:** Commercial tenants in zones are covered by commercial rent stabilization. No more displacing the taqueria to build a fusion restaurant.

6. **Community Land Trust Priority:** CLTs have right of first purchase for any residential property listed for sale within anti-displacement zones.

## How We Pay For It

Primarily regulatory (minimal direct cost). CBA requirements are funded by developers as a condition of building permits. Enforcement: $1-2M/year from development impact fees.

### International Evidence: Development Without Displacement

| City/Country | Model | Result |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| **Vienna, Austria** | All new residential development must include affordable units. City is the largest landowner and controls development through land policy. | Development continues at scale; no displacement crisis. Public housing and affordable mandates are the default, not the exception. |
| **Barcelona, Spain** | 30% affordable housing requirement for all new developments over 600 sqm. Anti-tourist-apartment regulations to protect residents. | Aggressive approach to housing as a right. Development continues while protecting existing communities. |
| **Montreal, Canada** | Inclusionary zoning requiring 20-30% affordable units in new developments. City acquires buildings to prevent speculation. | Among the most affordable major cities in North America despite being highly desirable. |
| **Singapore** | Government controls 80%+ of land. All development occurs on terms that serve the public, not speculators. | Highest homeownership rate in the world. Development serves residents because the public controls the land. |
| **Portland, OR** | Anti-displacement zones around transit. Mandatory relocation assistance. Community benefit agreements. | Among the strongest anti-displacement frameworks in the US. Model for linking transit investment to community protection. |

**The lesson is simple:** development is not inherently harmful. Development without public benefit requirements is. Every city that mandates affordability and community benefit alongside development gets both growth and stability.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Won't this stop development?"**
No. It ensures development benefits existing residents instead of displacing them. Developers can still build - they just have to build inclusively. If a project isn't viable with 30% affordable units, it was never viable - it was just subsidized by displacement.

**"Isn't 30% inclusionary too high?"**
Cities like Montreal, Barcelona, and several jurisdictions in the US have implemented 20-30% inclusionary requirements successfully. The key is that it applies to everyone equally - no competitive disadvantage.
