## The Problem

Denver residents pay $80-120/month for internet that is slower, less reliable, and more expensive than what residents of cities with municipal broadband receive. Comcast and CenturyLink operate as a de facto duopoly, providing:
- Inconsistent speeds that rarely match advertised rates
- Data caps designed to extract additional fees
- Poor customer service (Comcast is consistently rated the most-hated company in America)
- Lobbying against any competition, including municipal broadband
- Redlining: underinvestment in low-income and minority neighborhoods

Internet access is essential infrastructure — required for school, work, healthcare, and civic participation. Treating it as a luxury product controlled by monopolies is a policy failure.

## Our Solution

### Denver Fiber — City-Owned Broadband

**Infrastructure:**
- City-owned fiber optic network reaching every address in Denver
- Symmetrical gigabit speeds (1 Gbps up and down) for all tiers
- No data caps. No throttling. No hidden fees.

**Pricing:**

| Tier | Speed | Price |
|------|-------|-------|
| Basic | 100 Mbps | $15/month |
| Standard | 500 Mbps | $25/month |
| Gigabit | 1 Gbps | $30/month |
| Low-income | 100 Mbps | Free (income-qualified) |

Compare to Comcast: $80-120/month for comparable speeds with data caps and annual price increases.

**Key features:**
- **Net neutrality guaranteed** — no content blocking, throttling, or paid prioritization. Written into the charter.
- **No data caps.** Ever.
- **Privacy by default.** Denver Fiber does not sell, share, or monetize customer browsing data.
- **Free tier** for households at or below 200% federal poverty level
- **Digital literacy programs** at libraries and community centers
- **Free public WiFi** in all parks, community centers, and transit stations

**Rollout plan:**
- Year 1-2: Backbone infrastructure and first neighborhoods (prioritize underserved areas)
- Year 3-4: Expand to 50% of Denver addresses
- Year 5-7: Complete citywide buildout
- Revenue from early subscribers funds continued expansion

## How We Pay For It

**Capital cost:** $300-500M for citywide fiber buildout (based on comparable city deployments)

**Financing:** Revenue bonds backed by subscriber fees. Municipal broadband networks in Chattanooga, Longmont (CO), and Fort Collins (CO) are all financially self-sustaining.

**Longmont, Colorado** (30 miles north of Denver) did exactly this. NextLight municipal broadband: gigabit for $50/month, profitable within 5 years, beloved by residents. If Longmont can do it, Denver can do it.

**Net cost to taxpayers:** Negative within 5-7 years. Subscriber revenue exceeds debt service and operating costs.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Government can't run an ISP."**
Longmont, CO does. Chattanooga, TN does. Over 900 communities in the US have municipal broadband. They consistently outperform private ISPs in speed, reliability, price, and customer satisfaction.

**"This is unfair competition with private companies."**
Comcast and CenturyLink have had decades to provide good, affordable service. They chose monopoly profits instead. If they can't compete with a city-run network, that's their failure, not ours.

**"Won't this cost too much?"**
Longmont's fiber network was profitable within 5 years. Fort Collins is on track for the same. The infrastructure pays for itself through subscriber fees. This is an investment, not an expense.
