## Project Narrative

### A. Project Description

**Project Title:** Denver Housing First — Permanent Supportive Housing & Rapid Rehousing Expansion

**Applicant:** City and County of Denver, Department of Housing Stability (HOST), in coordination with the Metro Denver Homeless Initiative (MDHI) as Collaborative Applicant

**Requested Amount:** $17,000,000

**Project Duration:** 36 months

**Project Summary:** The City and County of Denver requests $17 million in Continuum of Care program funding to establish 300 new permanent supportive housing (PSH) units and provide rapid rehousing (RRH) services for 200 households annually, reducing chronic homelessness through the evidence-based Housing First model. Approximately 7,500 people experience homelessness in Denver on any given night, with 9,065 across the metro area according to the 2024 MDHI Point-in-Time Count. Denver currently operates roughly 1,300 PSH units — far below documented need. The existing crisis-response system spends $40,000-$80,000 per person per year cycling individuals through emergency rooms, jails, and shelters. Permanent supportive housing costs $15,000-$25,000 per person per year while achieving 80-90% housing retention rates. This project will generate net savings of $36,000-$62,000 per person per year while delivering stable housing and wraparound services to Denver's most vulnerable residents.

### B. Location & Context

**Project Area:** City and County of Denver, Colorado (population ~715,000)

**Continuum of Care:** Metro Denver Homeless Initiative (MDHI), CO-503

**Target Populations:**

- Chronically homeless individuals (HUD-defined: 12+ months continuous or 4+ episodes in 3 years, with disabling condition)
- Veterans experiencing homelessness
- Families with children experiencing homelessness
- Unaccompanied youth (18-24)
- Individuals exiting institutions (jails, hospitals, behavioral health facilities) into homelessness

**Priority Neighborhoods (ranked by unsheltered count and service need):**

- Capitol Hill / Civic Center
- Five Points / Curtis Park
- East Colfax
- Lincoln Park
- Sun Valley
- Globeville / Elyria-Swansea
- Montbello
- Westwood
- West Colfax
- Baker / Broadway

**Disadvantaged Community Status:** The majority of target neighborhoods qualify as disadvantaged communities under the Justice40 initiative, based on Census tract-level poverty rates, housing cost burden, and health vulnerability indices.

### C. Statement of Need

Denver faces a severe and growing homelessness crisis that the current system of emergency services cannot resolve:

**Scope of Homelessness:**

- ~7,500 people experiencing homelessness on any given night in Denver
- 9,065 across the metro area (MDHI Point-in-Time Count, 2024)
- Chronic homelessness has increased steadily as housing costs have outpaced wages
- Unsheltered homelessness is concentrated in neighborhoods with the fewest affordable housing resources

**Current System Capacity Gap:**

- ~1,300 PSH units currently operating in Denver as of 2024
- Documented need exceeds available units by thousands
- Emergency shelter system operates at or above capacity year-round
- Average wait time for a PSH placement exceeds 12 months through the coordinated entry system

**Cost of the Status Quo:**

- Emergency-system cycling (ER visits, jail bookings, police contacts, shelter stays) costs $40,000-$80,000 per person per year
- A single chronically homeless individual may generate over $100,000 in annual public costs across systems
- These expenditures produce no lasting housing outcomes — individuals cycle back into homelessness upon discharge

**The Housing First Evidence Base:**

- Housing First programs achieve 80-90% housing retention rates, compared to 30-50% for Treatment First approaches that require sobriety or program compliance as preconditions
- Finland adopted Housing First nationally and achieved a 35% reduction in homelessness — the only EU country with declining homelessness
- Houston housed 25,000+ individuals since 2012, reducing homelessness by 63% using coordinated Housing First strategies
- Medicine Hat, Canada achieved functional zero homelessness, housing every person within 10 days of identification
- Permanent supportive housing costs $15,000-$25,000 per person per year — generating net savings of $36,000-$62,000 per person per year compared to emergency-system cycling

### D. Project Activities & Deliverables

**Activity 1: Permanent Supportive Housing Acquisition & Conversion ($8,000,000)**

- Acquire and convert existing buildings (hotels, motels, underused commercial properties) into 300 PSH units
- All units to meet HUD Housing Quality Standards (HQS)
- Units distributed across multiple sites to avoid concentration and promote neighborhood integration
- On-site property management with 24/7 staffing at larger sites
- Low-barrier admission: no sobriety, treatment compliance, or income requirements for entry
- Coordinate with Denver's Social Housing Authority bonding capacity ($200-300M in startup capital from municipal bonds and federal HUD matching) for long-term sustainability beyond the grant period

**Activity 2: Rapid Rehousing Services & Landlord Incentives ($4,000,000)**

- Provide time-limited rental assistance (up to 24 months) for 200 households per year
- Landlord incentive fund: security deposit guarantees, damage mitigation funds, and signing bonuses to expand private-market unit availability
- Housing navigation staff to identify and secure units across Denver's rental market
- Progressive engagement model: calibrate assistance level to household need, stepping down support as stability increases
- Prioritize families with children and individuals with shorter homelessness histories for rapid rehousing track

**Activity 3: Wraparound Services — Case Management, Mental Health & Addiction Treatment ($3,000,000)**

- Intensive case management at 1:15 staff-to-client ratio for PSH residents
- On-site behavioral health services including licensed clinical social workers and psychiatric consultation
- Substance use treatment referrals and harm reduction services (non-abstinence-based)
- Employment and benefits enrollment assistance (SSI/SSDI, Medicaid, SNAP, veterans' benefits)
- Peer support specialists with lived experience of homelessness integrated into service teams
- Partnerships with Denver Health, Mental Health Center of Denver, and community-based organizations

**Activity 4: Coordinated Entry System Upgrade & Data Infrastructure ($1,000,000)**

- Upgrade MDHI's coordinated entry system to improve assessment, prioritization, and matching
- Integrate data across HOST, Denver Health, Denver Sheriff, and behavioral health providers to identify highest-need individuals (with appropriate privacy protections and consent protocols)
- Real-time bed/unit availability tracking across all PSH and RRH providers
- By-name list maintenance for chronic homelessness with monthly case conferencing
- HMIS data quality improvements to meet HUD reporting requirements and support program evaluation

**Activity 5: Program Evaluation ($1,000,000)**

- Independent third-party evaluation of housing retention, health outcomes, and cost offsets
- Pre/post analysis of emergency service utilization (ER visits, jail bookings, crisis contacts) for program participants
- Longitudinal tracking of participant income, employment, and housing stability at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months
- Cost-benefit analysis comparing per-person program costs to baseline emergency-system costs
- Qualitative research including participant interviews and case studies
- Final evaluation report with replication methodology for other CoC jurisdictions

### F. Alignment with HUD CoC Program Goals

This project directly advances the priorities identified in the HUD CoC Notice of Funding Opportunity:

1. **Ending chronic homelessness:** 300 new PSH units with wraparound services directly target the chronically homeless population using the HUD-endorsed Housing First approach
2. **Reducing unsheltered homelessness:** Rapid rehousing for 200 households/year provides a faster pathway out of unsheltered homelessness for individuals and families who do not require permanent support
3. **Shortening the length of time persons remain homeless:** Coordinated entry upgrades and real-time unit tracking reduce assessment-to-placement timelines
4. **Reducing returns to homelessness:** Housing First's 80-90% retention rate and intensive case management minimize returns compared to the current system
5. **Increasing employment and income for program participants:** Benefits enrollment and employment services integrated into case management
6. **Serving persons from underserved communities and marginalized populations:** Low-barrier admission and targeted outreach to communities disproportionately represented in Denver's homeless population

### G. Demonstrated Local Commitment

Denver has made substantial local investments in addressing homelessness:

- **Department of Housing Stability (HOST):** Dedicated city department coordinating homelessness response, affordable housing, and eviction prevention
- **Social Housing Authority:** Denver's initiative to develop publicly owned, permanently affordable housing with $200-300M in startup capital from municipal bonds and federal HUD matching
- **Denver Rescue Mission, Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, and network of 40+ service providers** delivering emergency shelter, transitional housing, and supportive services
- **Metro Denver Homeless Initiative (MDHI):** Regional collaborative applicant administering the coordinated entry system and HMIS for CO-503
- **Dedicated local funding** through the city's general fund, state grants, and philanthropic partnerships supporting existing PSH and RRH programs

The requested federal investment of $17 million complements Denver's existing infrastructure and local funding commitments. This is not a request to build a new system — it is a request to scale a proven model within a coordinated local ecosystem that is already operating but lacks the capacity to meet demand.
