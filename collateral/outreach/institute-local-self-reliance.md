## Partnership Inquiry Letter

**Subject:** Denver Municipal Broadband Research Partnership — Denver For All

Dear ILSR Community Broadband Networks team,

I'm reaching out to explore a research partnership between the Institute for Local Self-Reliance and Denver For All (denverforall.org) on Denver's municipal broadband campaign.

### Denver's Broadband Situation

In 2018, **85% of Denver voters** approved a ballot measure authorizing the city to build a municipal broadband network. Nearly 8 years later, it still hasn't been built. Meanwhile:

- Comcast and CenturyLink maintain effective duopoly control over Denver's broadband market
- Colorado communities like **Longmont** (NextLight: $50/month gigabit, profitable within 5 years, 90%+ satisfaction) and **Fort Collins** (Connexion: built despite $150M in Comcast opposition spending) have demonstrated the municipal model works
- Denver's inaction represents one of the largest unfulfilled broadband mandates in the country

### What We've Built

Denver For All has a comprehensive Municipal Broadband policy proposal that includes:
- Analysis of Denver's 2018 ballot measure and subsequent inaction
- Comparative case studies: Longmont, Fort Collins, Chattanooga, and other successful municipal networks
- Cost modeling and implementation pathways for a Denver municipal network ($30/month target)
- A federal grant template for the BEAD (Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment) program
- This proposal is part of our 47-policy platform reaching ~600 unique visitors/week

### Partnership Opportunities

1. **Research collaboration:** ILSR's data and expertise could strengthen our Denver-specific broadband analysis — market studies, cost modeling, and feasibility assessment
2. **Denver as a case study:** A city where 85% voted for municipal broadband and nothing happened is a powerful case study for ILSR's national advocacy
3. **Community engagement:** Our grassroots channels (social media, newsletter, Resistbot campaigns) can amplify ILSR research and community broadband advocacy in Denver
4. **Federal funding:** Our BEAD grant template could be strengthened with ILSR technical review
5. **2027 election:** Denver's upcoming municipal election is an opportunity to make broadband implementation a campaign issue — our candidate trackers can include broadband questions

### What We're Looking For

- Data and research support for Denver-specific broadband analysis
- Technical review of our municipal broadband proposal and BEAD grant template
- Potential joint publication or co-branded research
- Connection to ILSR's network of community broadband advocates and successful municipal network operators
- Guidance on advocacy strategy for moving Denver from voter mandate to implementation

This is a story ILSR's audience would find compelling: the largest unfulfilled municipal broadband mandate in America, and the grassroots campaign to finally build it.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
Denver For All
