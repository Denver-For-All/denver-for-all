## The Problem

Denver deposits hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars in Wall Street banks — JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America. These banks:
- Charge the city fees and pay minimal interest on deposits
- Use Denver's money to fund fossil fuel projects, predatory lending, and speculative trading
- Provide minimal lending to Denver small businesses and affordable housing
- Have been repeatedly fined for fraud, market manipulation, and consumer abuse
- Extract wealth from Denver and send it to shareholders in New York

Meanwhile, 6% of Denver households are unbanked and 18% are underbanked. Check-cashing services and payday lenders prey on low-income communities, charging fees that trap people in cycles of debt.

## Our Solution

### The Bank of Denver

A publicly owned, city-chartered bank modeled on the Bank of North Dakota (operating successfully since 1919).

**How it works:**
1. Denver deposits its operating funds, tax revenue, and reserves in the Bank of Denver instead of Wall Street banks
2. The bank uses these deposits to make low-interest loans for: affordable housing development, small business lending (priority: minority-owned, worker cooperatives), green energy and efficiency projects, and community land trust acquisitions
3. Interest revenue returns to the city — not to Wall Street shareholders
4. The bank partners with (doesn't compete with) local credit unions for retail services

**Key Programs:**

- **Affordable Housing Loan Fund:** Below-market interest rates for affordable housing developers, community land trusts, and the Social Housing Authority
- **Small Business Lending:** Microloans and small business loans that commercial banks won't make — especially for businesses in underserved neighborhoods
- **Green Energy Financing:** Low-interest loans for solar installation, energy efficiency, and electric vehicle purchase for Denver residents and businesses
- **Financial Inclusion:** Basic banking services (checking, savings, debit cards) for unbanked residents — no minimum balance, no predatory fees
- **Student Loan Refinancing:** Lower-interest refinancing for Denver residents with student debt (where legally permissible)

**Governance:**
- Board appointed by city council (not mayor alone)
- Professional bank management with banking expertise
- Annual public audit
- Transparent lending data published quarterly
- Community advisory committee with seats reserved for underserved populations

## How We Pay For It

**Startup:** $50-100M in initial capitalization from city reserves and bonds. This is not spending — it's moving money from Wall Street banks to a city-owned bank. The money still exists.

**Ongoing:** Self-sustaining through interest income. The Bank of North Dakota returns $100M+/year in profits to the state of North Dakota. Scaled for Denver, this could generate $20-50M/year in revenue for the city.

**Net cost to taxpayers:** Negative. The bank generates revenue.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Isn't public banking risky?"**
The Bank of North Dakota has operated for over 100 years, through the Great Depression, the 2008 financial crisis, and COVID — without a single year of losses. North Dakota has the lowest bank failure rate in the country. Public banking is boring banking — exactly what you want.

**"Can a city run a bank?"**
North Dakota does. Germany has over 400 public savings banks (Sparkassen) serving 50 million customers. Public banking is the norm in most of the world. The US is the outlier.

**"Will this hurt local banks and credit unions?"**
The Bank of Denver partners with local credit unions, not against them. It provides them with low-cost capital for community lending. It competes with Wall Street, not with community financial institutions.
