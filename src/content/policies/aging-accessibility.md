## The Problem

Denver's 65-and-older population stands at approximately 87,660 residents, or 12.3% of the city (U.S. Census Bureau, ACS 2019-2023). That number is accelerating fast. The Colorado State Demography Office projects that over 50% of the state's population growth by 2030 will be among adults 65 and older, a 36% increase adding nearly 317,000 older adults statewide. Denver skews younger than the national median, which means the city has built almost nothing for the demographic wave that is already arriving. Roughly 10% of Denver residents have a disability (ACS 2019-2023 5-Year Estimates), and disability rates rise sharply with age. The infrastructure, housing, transit, and services these residents need are not being built at the pace required.

The consequences of this neglect are already measurable. Nearly half of Denver seniors live alone, and the city scores a 7.0 on the Colorado Health Institute's Aging Vulnerability Index (where 10 is most vulnerable). Social isolation affects approximately 24% of Colorado seniors aged 65 and older (America's Health Rankings, 2024), and post-pandemic data shows the crisis deepening: 60% of older adults report spending more time at home than before COVID-19, 75% dine out less, and more than half have reduced attendance at religious services, gyms, and cultural venues (CU Boulder, 2024). The CDC links social isolation in older adults to a 50% increased risk of dementia and premature death risks comparable to smoking and obesity (CDC, 2021, "Loneliness and Social Isolation Linked to Serious Health Conditions"; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2020).

Meanwhile, the economics of aging in Denver are brutal. Nursing home care in Colorado costs upward of $10,600 per month, and long-term care costs in the state exceed the national average and have risen 6.2% annually since 1990 (Genworth/CareScout Cost of Care Survey, 2024). Assisted living averages $5,073 per month. Aging in place with part-time home health aides runs $33.50 per hour in Colorado, far cheaper than institutional care for most seniors but only if the housing, infrastructure, and support services exist. They largely do not. More than one-third of Colorado seniors who rent are severely cost-burdened, spending over 50% of their income on housing (National Low Income Housing Coalition, 2025). Denver saw a record 14,000-plus eviction filings in 2024 (Denver County Court records), and seniors on fixed incomes are, as service providers report, "quietly going without heat or medicine to afford rent." Denver's 3,110 miles of sidewalks include 1,235 miles that need ADA compliance upgrades and 355 miles that are missing entirely (City of Denver DOTI). RTD's paratransit system, Access-a-Ride, requires day-before reservations with a $4.50 fare, and riders routinely report late pickups and missed appointments. Family caregivers, overwhelmingly women, provide billions of dollars in unpaid labor with minimal public support. This is a systemic failure across housing, transportation, infrastructure, and services.

### What Denver Currently Does

Denver has a foundation to build on, but it is underfunded and fragmented. The Denver Office on Aging, housed within the Department of Human Rights and Community Partnerships, advocates for older residents and runs the DenverConnect program to bring city services into neighborhoods and assisted living centers, targeting low-income and minority seniors. Denver joined the WHO Global Network of Age-Friendly Cities and Communities through AARP in September 2014, launching the "Age Matters" initiative that originated with Mayor Hickenlooper's 2007 Summit on Aging and produced a report with recommendations in 2010. The Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) operates the Area Agency on Aging across an eight-county region, providing the Aging and Disability Resource Center, caregiver support (including a one-time voucher for up to 32 hours of respite care), and Meals on Wheels coordination.

RTD provides Access-a-Ride paratransit service (operating since 1997) and the newer Access-on-Demand program, which offers up to 60 rides per month through Uber, Lyft, and taxi services. Access-on-Demand monthly rides have grown to over 70,000, more than 10 times the ridership at launch (RTD, 2024). However, RTD's plan to impose a $4.50 base fare on Access-on-Demand rides prompted a federal lawsuit in late 2025 from disability advocates alleging discriminatory treatment. On sidewalk accessibility, a 2020 Denver Auditor report found the city's sidewalk repair program "decades behind schedule" and "not designed for ADA compliance," with 80% of sidewalks in the first repair region requiring work, about six times more than estimated. Voters approved a citywide sidewalk fee in November 2022 ($150/year per property owner), and in 2025 the city awarded $75 million in sidewalk construction contracts to begin addressing the backlog. Colorado's FAMLI paid family leave program, launched in 2024, provides up to 12 weeks of leave at 90% of earnings (up to $1,100/week) for caregiving, but awareness and uptake among family caregivers remain low.

## Our Solution

### 1. Age-Friendly City Design

- Complete sidewalk repair and curb ramp installation on all arterial streets within 5 years, leveraging the voter-approved sidewalk fee revenue and the $75 million in existing DOTI contracts
- Install benches and rest areas every 2 blocks in commercial districts and within 200 feet of all transit stops
- Extend pedestrian crossing times at all signalized intersections to accommodate slower walking speeds, with audible signals and countdown timers at every crosswalk
- Require universal design features in all new multifamily construction: zero-step entries, wide doorways (36 inches minimum), reinforced bathroom walls for future grab bar installation, and lever-style hardware
- Improve wayfinding and signage citywide for cognitive accessibility: high-contrast, large-font, multilingual signage with pictograms at all city facilities, transit stops, and parks

### 2. Senior Services Expansion

- Establish a senior center in every council district with weekday and weekend programming, including fitness classes, health screenings, legal aid clinics, and cultural programming
- Provide free RTD transit passes for all Denver residents aged 65 and older, eliminating the cost barrier that keeps seniors isolated
- Expand Meals on Wheels to serve all eligible seniors with zero waitlists, including culturally appropriate meal options and weekend delivery
- Create a Senior Employment Program: city-funded part-time positions in parks, libraries, recreation centers, and mentoring programs, providing meaningful work and supplemental income
- Offer technology literacy programs at every Denver Public Library branch and senior center, covering smartphones, telehealth, online banking, and social media connection with family

### 3. Universal Accessibility

- Adopt universal design standards for all city facilities that exceed ADA minimums: automatic doors, tactile wayfinding, adjustable-height counters, and hearing loop systems in all public meeting spaces
- Conduct a comprehensive accessibility audit of all city buildings, parks, recreation centers, and transit stops, with results published on a public dashboard updated quarterly
- Install accessible playground equipment in every Denver park, including wheelchair-accessible swings, sensory play panels, and rubberized surfacing
- Require sensory-friendly programming hours at all recreation centers and city-funded cultural facilities (reduced lighting, lower volume, quiet spaces)
- Bring all City of Denver websites and digital services into full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, with a commitment to WCAG 2.2 AA within 3 years

### 4. Caregiver Support

- Create a city-funded respite care program providing 40 free hours per quarter for family caregivers of older adults and people with disabilities, going beyond the DRCOG one-time 32-hour voucher
- Establish Caregiver Resource Centers in at least 4 locations across Denver, offering information, training, support groups, and connections to legal and financial planning services
- Fund a Home Modification Grant Program for aging in place: grants of up to $10,000 per household for ramps, grab bars, walk-in showers, stair lifts, and other modifications that keep seniors in their homes
- Advocate for expanding Colorado's FAMLI paid leave program to cover extended caregiving periods, and promote awareness of existing benefits among Denver residents (cross-reference: Paid Leave policy)

### 5. Social Isolation Prevention

- Fund intergenerational programming citywide: senior-youth mentoring in schools, shared community garden plots, co-located senior centers and childcare facilities, and oral history projects pairing elders with students
- Launch a Community Health Worker program specifically for isolated seniors: regular home visits, wellness check-ins, connection to services, and companionship, staffed by trained, paid community members
- Expand transportation to social activities through a volunteer driver program, expanded paratransit evening and weekend hours, and partnerships with rideshare companies for subsidized social trips
- Adopt pet-friendly senior housing policies: no breed or size restrictions in city-funded senior housing, and a pet care assistance program for seniors who need help with veterinary costs or dog walking
- Designate community gathering spaces in every neighborhood: weekly coffee hours, game nights, exercise groups, and cultural events in libraries, recreation centers, and senior centers, with programming designed by residents

Investing in age-friendly infrastructure is not a niche concern for today's seniors alone. It is an investment in everyone's future. Every resident of Denver will age. Every resident will, at some point, benefit from a curb ramp, a bench, an accessible bathroom, a crossing signal that gives enough time to cross safely. The cities that rank highest for livability in the world, Vienna, Copenhagen, Tokyo, are the ones that designed for their oldest and most vulnerable residents first. Universal design is not charity. It is good urbanism. Denver can either plan for the demographic reality arriving in the next decade or pay far more to react to it in emergency rooms, nursing homes, and isolation-driven decline.

## How We Pay For It

- **Sidewalk and accessibility infrastructure repairs**: $10-15M/year from DOTI capital budget, supplemented by voter-approved sidewalk fee revenue ($97.5M over 3 years already committed) and federal ADA compliance funding
- **Senior services expansion** (centers, transit passes, meals, employment): $8-12M/year from general fund, with Older Americans Act federal matching funds through DRCOG
- **Caregiver support** (respite, resource centers, home modifications): $3-5M/year, with significant Medicaid offset through Colorado's Elderly, Blind and Disabled Waiver and the new Community First Choice program (launched July 2025)
- **Social isolation prevention** (community health workers, intergenerational programs, transportation): $2-3M/year, largely volunteer-powered with city coordination staff and AmeriCorps partnerships
- **Total: $25-35M/year**, with significant healthcare cost savings. Aging in place with community support costs a fraction of institutional care: home-based support averages $2,000-4,000/month versus $10,600+/month for a nursing home in Colorado. Every senior who avoids or delays nursing home placement saves the Medicaid system tens of thousands of dollars annually. This is sound fiscal policy as much as compassionate policy.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Denver is a young city. Why focus on aging?"**
Denver's median age is 35.2, but that makes the coming demographic shift more urgent, not less. The Colorado State Demography Office projects that over 50% of the state's population growth through 2030 will be among adults 65 and older. Denver's 65+ population is the fastest-growing demographic segment in the metro area. And every 25-year-old in Denver today will be a 65-year-old in Denver in 40 years. Building age-friendly infrastructure now is cheaper than retrofitting later, and every accessibility improvement, from curb ramps to benches to better crosswalks, benefits residents of all ages, including parents with strollers, people with temporary injuries, and anyone carrying groceries.

**"ADA compliance is already required by law. Isn't that enough?"**
ADA sets a legal floor, not a livability standard. The 2020 Denver Auditor report found the city's sidewalk program was not even designed for ADA compliance and was decades behind schedule. Meeting ADA minimums means a ramp exists; it does not mean a senior with a walker can safely navigate from their home to a bus stop on a continuous, well-maintained path. Universal design goes beyond compliance to create spaces that actually work for people with disabilities, older adults, and everyone else. The gap between ADA minimum and genuine accessibility is where people fall, literally and figuratively.

**"This is too expensive for a city budget."**
Aging in place with community support costs $2,000-4,000 per month. A nursing home in Colorado costs over $10,600 per month, and those costs are rising faster than inflation. Every dollar spent on home modifications, caregiver respite, senior transportation, and social connection is a dollar that prevents far more expensive institutional care, emergency room visits, and Medicaid spending. The AARP estimates that family caregivers provide $600 billion in unpaid care nationally each year. A modest investment in supporting those caregivers generates enormous returns.

**"Isn't caring for aging parents a family responsibility, not the government's?"**
Family caregivers are the backbone of eldercare in America, and they are burning out. The average family caregiver provides 24 hours of unpaid care per week while also working. Caregiver stress leads to higher rates of depression, chronic illness, and premature death among caregivers themselves. Supporting caregivers with respite, training, and resources is not replacing family responsibility. It is making family caregiving sustainable. Countries with the strongest family bonds, like Japan and Italy, also have the most robust public support systems for eldercare, because they recognize that families cannot do it alone.

**"How does this relate to housing affordability?"**
Directly. More than one-third of Colorado seniors who rent are severely cost-burdened, and seniors on fixed incomes are among the most vulnerable to displacement when rents rise. Our Social Housing, Rent Stabilization, and Anti-Displacement policies all have direct implications for senior housing security. Universal design requirements in new construction ensure that the affordable housing we build is accessible housing. Home modification grants keep seniors in existing homes rather than forcing moves to expensive assisted living. These policies work together: you cannot have an age-friendly city without affordable, accessible housing (cross-reference: Social Housing, Rent Control, Anti-Displacement policies).
