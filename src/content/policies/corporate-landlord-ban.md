## The Problem

Since 2020, institutional investors - private equity firms, hedge funds, and corporate landlord companies - have been buying up single-family homes and apartment buildings across Denver at an accelerating rate. These entities:

- Purchase homes with all-cash offers that individual families cannot compete with
- Convert owner-occupied homes to rentals, reducing homeownership rates
- Maximize rent extraction through algorithmic pricing software (like RealPage, currently facing federal antitrust lawsuits)
- Minimize maintenance to maximize returns to shareholders
- File evictions at rates 2-3x higher than individual landlords
- Are accountable to Wall Street, not to Denver

When Blackstone, Invitation Homes, or Progress Residential buys a home in your neighborhood, that home will never again be affordable for a family to buy. It becomes a permanent extraction machine.

### What Denver Currently Does

Denver has **no restrictions on institutional ownership of residential property**. Nationally, investors purchased approximately 26% of low-priced single-family homes sold in 2023, and about 18.5% of all homes sold (Redfin data). In Denver specifically, Invitation Homes (owned by Blackstone) is one of the largest single-family landlords, with hundreds of properties in the metro area. Progress Residential and American Homes 4 Rent also maintain significant Denver portfolios.

In August 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil antitrust lawsuit against RealPage, alleging its algorithmic pricing software enabled landlords to coordinate above-market rent increases -- effectively constituting price-fixing. (Private class-action lawsuits were filed beginning in late 2022.) Multiple Denver-area property management companies have been identified as RealPage clients.

## Our Solution

### The Denver Homes for Humans Act

**1. Acquisition Ban**
Entities owning 50+ residential units nationally are prohibited from acquiring additional residential property (1-4 units) within Denver city limits. This includes:
- Direct purchases
- Purchases through subsidiaries, LLCs, or shell companies
- Rent-to-own schemes that result in corporate ownership
- Foreclosure acquisitions

**2. Divestiture Requirement**
Existing corporate holders of 50+ units must divest residential properties (1-4 units) within 5 years of ordinance passage. Divestiture must be:
- To individual owner-occupants, community land trusts, or the Social Housing Authority
- At independently appraised fair market value (no inflated pricing)
- With right of first refusal for current tenants

**3. Beneficial Ownership Transparency**
All LLCs and corporate entities owning residential property in Denver must disclose their full beneficial ownership chain - the actual humans who own and profit. No hiding behind shell companies.
- Annual disclosure required
- Public registry maintained by the city
- Failure to disclose: property tax assessed at 3x standard rate

**4. Algorithmic Pricing Ban**
Property owners and management companies are prohibited from using algorithmic pricing software (RealPage, Yardi, etc.) that coordinates pricing across competing landlords. This is price-fixing, whether done by humans in a room or by an algorithm in a server.

**5. Penalty Structure**
- First violation: $50,000 per property
- Subsequent violations: $100,000 per property + mandatory divestiture
- Criminal referral for pattern violations

### International Evidence: Housing Is Not a Financial Instrument

| Country | Model | Result |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **Denmark** | Non-residents and non-Danish companies cannot buy residential property without permission. Owner-occupancy requirements for many housing types. | Housing remains primarily for residents, not investors. Prices are more stable. Homeownership serves families, not portfolios. |
| **New Zealand** | Banned foreign buyers of existing residential property (2018). | Removed speculative demand. Housing price growth slowed. Domestic buyers face less competition from international capital. |
| **Germany** | Strong tenant protections and rent regulations make residential property a low-return investment, naturally discouraging speculative acquisition. *Wohnungsgemeinnützigkeit* (housing public benefit) laws historically limited profits on housing. | Corporate landlords exist but operate under heavy regulation. Housing is not the speculative asset class it is in the US. |
| **Berlin, Germany** | 2021 referendum: 59% voted to expropriate 240,000 apartments from large corporate landlords (Deutsche Wohnen, Vonovia). Implementation ongoing. | Democratic mandate to take housing back from corporate landlords. The movement is global. |
| **Spain** | Catalonia's new housing law (2023) forces large landlords to rent vacant properties in high-demand areas or face expropriation. | Directly addresses corporate vacancy and speculation. |

**The US is one of the only countries that treats residential housing primarily as an investment vehicle.** Most countries regulate who can buy housing and how it can be used because they recognize that shelter is a human need, not an asset class.

## How We Pay For It

This is a regulation, not a spending program. Enforcement costs ($1-2M/year) are covered by violation penalties and the transparency registry fee ($500/entity/year).

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Is this legal?"**
Cities regulate who can operate businesses within their boundaries all the time. This is no different from zoning laws that restrict commercial activity in residential areas. Property ownership is already subject to extensive regulation.

**"Won't this reduce available rental housing?"**
Corporate landlords don't build housing - they buy existing housing and extract higher rents. Every unit they're forced to sell becomes available for an individual buyer, a cooperative, or a community land trust. The housing doesn't disappear.

**"What about small landlords with multiple properties?"**
The 50-unit threshold specifically targets institutional investors, not the person who owns a duplex or a few rental properties. Small landlords are not the problem.

**"What about apartment complexes?"**
Large multifamily buildings (50+ units) are excluded from the acquisition ban because they've always been investor-owned. The focus is on 1-4 unit residential properties - the homes that families should be able to buy.
