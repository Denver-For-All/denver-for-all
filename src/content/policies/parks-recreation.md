## The Problem

Denver's park system is ranked 10th in the nation by the Trust for Public Land's 2025 ParkScore Index, with a score of 75.1 out of 100 and 97% of residents living within a 10-minute walk of a park. The city maintains over 250 urban parks, 30 recreation centers, 32 pools, more than 130 miles of off-street trails, and a unique 14,000-acre mountain park system in the foothills west of the city. Denver spends $229 per capita on parks and recreation, well above the $133 national average (Trust for Public Land, 2025). These aggregate numbers tell a story of success. They hide a story of deep inequity.

Residents in low-income Denver neighborhoods have access to 24% less park space per person than those in the average neighborhood and 48% less than residents of high-income neighborhoods. Residents of color have access to 23% less nearby park space than those living in white neighborhoods (Trust for Public Land ParkScore, 2025). Research from the University of Illinois found that nearly all of the large parks built in Denver between 1990 and 2015 were located in neighborhoods that are now affluent and majority-white, a direct legacy of exclusionary zoning codes and funding policies that directed park investment toward the wealthiest districts. The neighborhoods along the "Inverted L," running along I-25 and I-70 through Globeville-Elyria-Swansea, Montbello, Westwood, Sun Valley, and Northeast Park Hill, have both the lowest tree canopy coverage and the highest heat exposure, with temperatures 15 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than well-canopied neighborhoods (Denver Digs Trees / The Park People, 2021). Youth from these low-income and ethnically diverse neighborhoods have less access to parks and fewer opportunities for play in natural green spaces (Children & Nature Network, 2019).

Denver's recreation centers charge annual membership fees ranging from $190 to $369 for adults, with a tiered system of Neighborhood, Local, and Regional access levels. While free My Denver memberships exist for youth ages 5-18 and adults 60+, awareness and enrollment barriers persist. Community garden demand far outstrips supply. Denver Urban Gardens manages over 200 community gardens across the metro area, but waitlists remain long in the neighborhoods that need them most. Trail connectivity gaps persist, particularly in surface quality, wayfinding, and physical discontinuities on the northern sections of the South Platte Trail and connecting corridors like Toll Gate Creek. And Denver's 14,000-acre mountain park system, one of the most unique municipal park assets in the country, faces chronic underfunding, deferred maintenance, and increasing wildfire risk, with the dedicated levy that sustained the parks from 1913 discontinued in 1955.

### What Denver Currently Does

Denver Parks & Recreation operates with a 2025 recommended budget of $97.3 million and 600 FTEs. The department manages the full system of urban parks, recreation centers, pools, trails, and the mountain parks. The Game Plan for a Healthy City, adopted in 2019 with input from more than 6,000 residents, serves as the department's master plan. It analyzed park access along lines of income, race, and ethnicity, accounting for vehicle access and obesity rates, to identify underserved, high-need neighborhoods and developed an implementation strategy that prioritizes areas most in need of investment (Sasaki / Denver Parks & Recreation, 2019).

In 2018, Denver voters passed Measure 2A, a 0.25% sales tax dedicated to park improvement and expansion, generating approximately $45 million annually. These funds have been guided by a Neighborhood Equity Index that combines park access data with morbidity, poverty, education, and food access indicators. The Denver Park Trust directs 95% of its projects to neighborhoods rated 4 or 5 on this Equity Index. Great Outdoors Colorado (GOCO) provides additional grant funding, including a $7 million award for High Line Canal improvements and $500,000 for the Bluff Lake Nature Center in northeast Denver. GOCO's latest funding cycle exceeded $117 million statewide, the largest in its history (GOCO, 2024).

Progress is real but uneven. The 2A sales tax has enabled new investments in underserved areas, but the five-year capital improvement plan (2020-2025) is now concluding, and many Game Plan goals remain unfulfilled. Deferred maintenance backlogs persist. Recreation center programming does not reach all residents who need it. Mountain parks continue to compete with urban parks for limited dollars. Denver's park system is good. It is not yet equitable.

The public health evidence is clear. Systematic reviews published in *Preventive Medicine* (2021) confirm that park-based interventions increase physical activity and improve both physical and mental health outcomes. Proximity to parks and green space is associated with reduced depressive symptoms, lower obesity rates, improved cardiovascular health, and better cognitive performance in children. Parks reduce urban heat island effects. Research shows that tree canopy cover of 40% or more can effectively counter the warming effect of impervious surfaces at the city-block scale (Ziter et al., 2019, *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*). Parks improve air quality, reduce stormwater runoff, and provide clean air shelters during wildfire smoke events. Every dollar invested in parks returns multiple dollars in reduced healthcare costs, reduced crime, increased property values, and improved quality of life. Parks are not amenities. They are public health infrastructure.

## How We Pay For It

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Denver already has great parks. We're ranked 10th in the nation."**
Denver's aggregate ParkScore ranking hides enormous disparities within the city. Residents in low-income neighborhoods have 48% less park space per person than residents of high-income neighborhoods. Youth of color have less access to natural play spaces. Tree canopy coverage along the "Inverted L" neighborhoods is a fraction of coverage in wealthier areas. A top-10 national ranking means nothing to a child in Montbello whose nearest park is poorly maintained, lacks shade, and has no programming. Equity, not averages, is the standard.

**"Free recreation center access is too expensive."**
Denver spends over $95,000 per year to incarcerate a single youth in the Division of Youth Services. A year of free recreation center access, with after-school programs, sports leagues, and mentorship, costs a fraction of that. Obesity-related healthcare costs in Colorado exceed $2.4 billion annually. Free recreation access is not an expense; it is the cheapest prevention strategy available. Every city that has expanded free youth recreation has seen reductions in juvenile crime and improvements in youth health outcomes.

**"Community gardens are nice but they don't scale."**
Denver Urban Gardens already manages over 200 community gardens and 24 food forests across the metro area, the largest independent network of food-producing gardens in the United States. DUG gardeners donate 10% of their harvest to food banks and mutual aid organizations. The Urban Garden Project, led by DUG, is a national initiative positioning community gardens as essential urban infrastructure. The model works. The question is whether the city will invest in it at the scale the demand requires.

**"Why invest in mountain parks when city parks need work?"**
This is a both/and proposition, not either/or. Denver's 14,000-acre mountain park system is a nationally significant historic asset designed by Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. and listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and has been chronically underfunded since 1955. Wildfire risk to these parks is increasing every year. Meanwhile, free shuttle service to mountain parks directly serves equity goals by removing transportation barriers for residents who cannot afford to drive to the foothills. Protecting the mountain parks and investing in urban park equity are complementary priorities.

**"How do you measure park equity?"**
The Trust for Public Land's ParkScore methodology evaluates cities across five categories: park access, acreage, investment, amenities, and equity. Denver's own Neighborhood Equity Index combines park access data with morbidity rates, poverty levels, education attainment, and food access to identify the neighborhoods most in need of investment. The Denver Park Trust uses this index to direct 95% of its projects to neighborhoods rated 4 or 5. Measurement tools exist. What matters is whether the city commits to acting on what the data reveals.
