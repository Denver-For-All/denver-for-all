# Denver For All: Communications Strategy Review (Updated February 2026)

## Executive Summary

This is the second comprehensive audit of the Denver For All communications strategy. The first review (mid-2025) identified critical gaps across a 25-policy platform: zero citations, no local Denver context, missing counter-arguments, and no audience-specific messaging. Since then, the platform has grown to **45 policies, 8 interactive tools, 6 federal grant templates, and a full outreach playbook**. The improvements have been substantial.

**What's been fixed:**
- Citations and references sections added across all 45 policies
- "What Denver Currently Does" sections added to every policy
- 10 of 12 originally flagged missing FAQs now addressed
- Year-stamped statistics throughout
- Opposition/stakeholder analysis ("Who Opposes This") added to many policies
- Legal feasibility addressed in contested policies (TABOR, CRS 38-12-301, NLRA)
- Outreach playbook with channel strategies, sample content, and cadence calendar
- 8 interactive civic tools (eviction tracker, rent calculator, campaign finance, AI tenant rights chatbot, candidate trackers, Resistbot campaigns, sidewalk data)
- 6 grant proposal templates anchored to specific policies

**What still needs work:**
1. Remaining FAQ gaps (2 policies still missing their most predictable objection)
2. Tool integration (tools are siloed; no cross-linking to policies or each other)
3. Outreach materials reference "25 policies" throughout — need updating to 45
4. Resistbot campaigns cover only 5 of 45 policies
5. Anti-displacement policy appears incomplete (truncated file)
6. Bilingual parity remains unresolved
7. Audience-specific messaging still not developed
8. Contrast messaging exists in outreach docs but not in policies themselves

This review covers five areas:
1. **Scorecard: original gaps and their current status**
2. **New gaps introduced by platform expansion**
3. **Tool and infrastructure communications gaps**
4. **Outreach material currency**
5. **Updated priority actions**

## 1. Scorecard: Original Gaps vs. Current Status

### 1.1 Citations and Evidence (ORIGINAL: Critical — CURRENT: Resolved)

The original review's single biggest finding — zero citations across all policies — has been comprehensively addressed. Every policy now includes inline citations with source names and years. The majority (35+ of 45) include formal references sections at the bottom with 6-18 sources each.

**Standout policies for citation quality:**
- Drug Policy (11 references, dedicated section, Potier et al. systematic review cited)
- Healthcare (11 references, nuances the Himmelstein bankruptcy claim per original recommendation)
- Public Safety (40+ citations, 2026 Urban Institute evaluation data)
- Government Transparency (35+ citations, current 2025 surveillance data)
- Pedestrian Infrastructure (16 references, January 2026 State of System Report)

**Remaining citation concerns:**
- Anti-Displacement Zones has incomplete references (file appears truncated — see Section 2.1)
- Some policies have lighter references sections (Public Banking: 6 references; Youth Services: 6 references) compared to the platform average of 10+
- International comparison claims still occasionally lack specific page numbers or dataset identifiers

### 1.2 Year-Stamped Statistics (ORIGINAL: Critical — CURRENT: Resolved)

All 45 policies now include year-stamped statistics. Data ranges primarily from 2022-2026, with foundational research cited back to original publication dates. Denver minimum wage, rent figures, and budget numbers carry current year tags.

**Note:** Statistics from early-2024 or earlier should be reviewed for annual refresh. Denver's minimum wage, MIT Living Wage Calculator figures, PIT count numbers, and eviction filing data all update on annual cycles. Recommend a quarterly review pass to flag stale data.

### 1.3 "What Denver Currently Does" Sections (ORIGINAL: Critical — CURRENT: Resolved)

Every one of the 45 policies now includes a "What Denver Currently Does" section. The 8 specific programs flagged in the original review are all now acknowledged:

| Policy | Existing Program | Status |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| Community Land Trusts | Elevation CLT (est. 2003, ~300 homes) | Mentioned with scale and limitations |
| Paid Leave | Colorado FAMLI (effective Jan 2024) | Detailed comparative table showing gaps |
| Municipal Broadband | Denver Measure 2J (2018, 85% approval) | Framed as "why hasn't it been built?" per original recommendation |
| Drug Policy | Proposition 301 (2019) + Prop 122 (2022) | Full context including 827 overdose deaths (2023) |
| Public Safety | Office of Independent Monitor | Detailed with OIM limitations, STAR data, Flock contract |
| Education | Colorado Universal Pre-K (CDEC) | Noted 15 hrs/week limitation, DPS crisis context |
| Childcare | CCCAP | Coverage gaps and age-range gaps documented |
| Climate | 80x50 Plan, Climate Protection Fund | $40M/year fund noted with progress assessment |

### 1.4 Missing FAQ Counter-Arguments (ORIGINAL: Critical — CURRENT: Mostly Resolved)

10 of 12 originally flagged missing FAQs have been addressed:

| Policy | Missing FAQ (Original) | Status |
|--------|----------------------|--------|
| Drug Policy | "What about Oregon Measure 110?" | **FIXED** — FAQ #4 addresses Oregon directly ("only 10% of allocated funds spent on treatment") |
| Immigration | "$100M+ migrant spending?" | **FIXED** — Addressed in "What Denver Currently Does" and FAQ with federal reimbursement framing |
| Living Wage | "Border effects with Aurora/Lakewood?" | **FIXED** — FAQ #4 cites Dube et al. 2010 border study showing minimal cross-border effects |
| Municipal Broadband | "Voters approved in 2018, what happened?" | **FIXED** — FAQ #4 directly addresses this; turned into offensive framing |
| Vacancy Tax | "TABOR legality?" | **FIXED** — Addressed in main text ("voter approval required — this is not a barrier") |
| Paid Leave | "Doesn't FAMLI cover this?" | **FIXED** — FAQ #4 explains Denver supplement rationale with comparative table |
| Public Safety | "Current crime trends?" | **FIXED** — FAQ addresses with specific data (auto thefts down from 12,000 to 8,500) |
| Participatory Budgeting | "Wealthy neighborhood dominance?" | **FIXED** — FAQ addresses with weighted allocation and outreach mandates |
| Education | "Colorado already has Pre-K?" | **FIXED** — FAQ addresses 15 hrs/week limitation |
| Rent Control | "Small landlords with mortgages?" | **PARTIAL** — FAQ #3 discusses small landlords but does not specifically address mortgage burden or refinancing cycles |
| Social Housing | "Where will units go? NIMBYism?" | **MISSING** — FAQ addresses management capacity but not site selection or neighborhood opposition |
| Corporate Landlord Ban | "Forced divestiture fire sale?" | **MISSING** — Solution mentions "fair market value" but no FAQ addresses the fire sale objection directly |

### 1.5 Stakeholder / Opposition Analysis (ORIGINAL: Missing — CURRENT: Partially Resolved)

Many of the newer policies include "Who Opposes This (and Why)" sections that name specific opposition groups, their likely arguments, and preemptive responses. This is a significant improvement. However, coverage is uneven:

**Policies with strong opposition analysis:** Public Safety, Government Transparency, One Fair Wage, Fiscal Reform, Corporate Landlord Ban, Small Business, Immigration Sanctuary, Autonomous Vehicles

**Policies still missing opposition analysis:** Social Housing, Rent Control, Community Land Trusts, Housing First, Paid Leave, Education, Works Councils

### 1.6 Legal Feasibility (ORIGINAL: Missing — CURRENT: Mostly Resolved)

The Legislation-Ready analysis document addresses legal pathways systematically (Tier 1-4 framework). Individual policies now address their primary legal constraints:

| Policy | Legal Issue | Status |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Vacancy Tax | TABOR voter approval | Addressed in policy text |
| Rent Control | CRS 38-12-301 preemption | Addressed with full legislative history table (2019-2026) |
| Works Councils | NLRA preemption | FAQ addresses; proposes city employee / contractor scope |
| Sectoral Bargaining | NLRA preemption | FAQ #4 addresses directly; proposes voluntary + incentive model |
| Corporate Landlord Ban | Takings clause | Addressed in FAQ (legality question) but fire sale mechanics still missing |

### 1.7 Named Political Actors (ORIGINAL: Missing — CURRENT: Partially Resolved)

The policy pages themselves still do not name specific politicians. However, the outreach materials (REDDIT-COMMENTS.md, OUTREACH-PLAYBOOK.md) and tools (Follow the Money scorecard, candidate trackers) now provide this contrast. The separation is arguably appropriate — policies stay factual while outreach materials do the contrast work.

**Remaining gap:** The Follow the Money tool tracks council votes and campaign contributions, but this data does not feed back into policy narratives. No policy page says "Council voted X on Y" or "Denver spent $Z on this contract." The dots remain unconnected for users who only read policy pages.

### 1.8 Bilingual Parity (ORIGINAL: Missing — CURRENT: Still Missing)

This remains the largest unresolved gap from the original review. All 45 policies have Spanish titles and summaries in frontmatter, and the site UI is bilingual. But the full policy substance — the problem statements, solutions, evidence tables, and FAQs — remains English-only. For 30%+ of Denver's population, the substantive content is inaccessible.

The Outreach Playbook identifies this gap and proposes a phased approach (5 flagship policies first), but there is no evidence that full translations have been completed.

---

## 2. New Gaps Introduced by Platform Expansion

The platform has grown from 25 to 45 policies since the original review. This expansion introduced new communications vulnerabilities:

### 2.1 Anti-Displacement Zones Policy is Incomplete

The anti-displacement policy file appears truncated at ~72 lines, cutting off mid-FAQ. It is missing:
- Complete FAQ section (only 2 items vs. platform average of 4-5)
- References section
- International evidence table
- Detailed funding mechanisms

**Priority:** This file needs to be completed before any public-facing traffic is directed to it.

### 2.2 Thin Policies

While most of the 45 policies are substantive (150-250 lines with 8-18 references), several are noticeably lighter:

| Policy | Lines | References | FAQ Items | Concern |
|--------|-------|------------|-----------|---------|
| Anti-Displacement | ~72 | 0 | 2 | Incomplete file |
| Community Land Trusts | ~77 | Limited | 2 | Light for a flagship housing policy |
| Public Banking | ~101 | 6 | 5 | Missing regulatory pathway detail |
| Gig Worker Protections | ~103 | 8 | 2 | Only 2 FAQs |

Community Land Trusts is especially notable — it is a core housing policy that should be as robust as Social Housing or Rent Control.

### 2.3 Policy Interdependencies Not Mapped

The 45 policies form natural clusters but cross-references between them are inconsistent:

- **Immigration cluster** (4 policies: Sanctuary, Newcomer Reception, Workforce Integration, Anti-Exploitation) functions as a coherent system but separation creates redundancy and potential contradictions
- **Housing cluster** (9 policies) rarely cross-references each other — a reader of Social Housing doesn't learn about Community Land Trusts or Anti-Displacement Zones
- **Climate/environment cluster** (Climate, Water Security, Waste/Circular Economy, Emergency Preparedness, Parks) has overlapping funding mechanisms not always reconciled
- **Labor cluster** (Living Wage, One Fair Wage, Paid Leave, Gig Workers, Works Councils, Sectoral Bargaining, Right to Disconnect, Small Business) could benefit from a "how these fit together" narrative

**Recommendation:** Add a "Related Policies" section to each policy page linking to 2-3 complementary proposals. This helps users understand the platform as a system rather than 45 isolated proposals.

### 2.4 Implementation Timelines Remain Vague

Most policies say "by 2030" or "by 2035" without phased milestones. The Legislation-Ready document provides a 6-month filing order for Tier 1 proposals, but this doesn't map onto the policy pages themselves. A reader of any individual policy has no idea whether it could happen in 6 months or requires a decade of state-level advocacy.

**Recommendation:** Add a brief "Implementation Pathway" line to each policy (e.g., "City council ordinance — can be filed immediately" or "Requires state legislative action — current bill: HB23-1115").

### 2.5 Enforcement Mechanisms Underdeveloped

Many policies propose requirements (inclusionary zoning percentages, construction waste diversion targets, winter sidewalk maintenance) without specifying how the city will monitor compliance or penalize violations. This is a predictable attack vector: "Sounds nice, but who enforces it?"

---

## 3. Tool and Infrastructure Communications Gaps

The platform now includes 8 interactive tools — a major asset that did not exist during the original review. However, they have significant communications gaps:

### 3.1 Tools Are Siloed

Each tool operates independently with minimal cross-linking:

| Tool | Links to Policy Page? | Links to Other Tools? |
|------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Eviction Tracker | Yes (Housing First) | No |
| Rent Calculator | No | No |
| Follow the Money | Yes (Government Transparency) | No |
| Know Your Rights (AI Chatbot) | No | No |
| Council Candidate Tracker | References platform issues | No |
| Mayoral Tracker | References platform issues | No |
| Resistbot Campaigns | Yes (Public Safety) | No |
| Sidewalk Data Explorer | Yes (Pedestrian Infrastructure) | No |

**Only 5 of 8 tools link to their corresponding policy page.** Zero tools link to other tools. A user who finds the Eviction Tracker never discovers the Know Your Rights chatbot. A user of the Rent Calculator never sees the rent stabilization policy it's based on.

**Fix:** Add a "Related Resources" block to each tool page linking to (a) the relevant policy, (b) 1-2 related tools, and (c) the relevant Resistbot campaign if one exists.

### 3.2 Know Your Rights Chatbot is Completely Isolated

The AI tenant rights assistant is the most impressive tool on the platform (24/7, bilingual, powered by vAPI) but it exists in total isolation. No link to any policy page. No link to the eviction tracker. No link to the rent calculator. No "Learn More" pathway. A tenant who gets legal information from the chatbot has no way to discover that an entire policy platform exists to address the structural problems behind their situation.

### 3.3 Resistbot Campaigns Cover Only 5 of 45 Policies

The Resistbot integration is a powerful organizing tool — pre-written letters that constituents can send to elected officials in minutes. But only 5 campaigns exist, covering housing, surveillance, elections, and democracy. There are no campaigns for:

- Healthcare / medical debt forgiveness
- Living wage / One Fair Wage
- STAR program expansion
- Municipal broadband
- Climate / environmental justice
- Transportation / transit
- Disability rights
- Immigration protections
- Drug policy reform
- Any of the 20 newer policies

This is the single highest-leverage communications gap on the platform. Each Resistbot campaign converts a policy reader into a constituent who contacts their elected official. Expanding from 5 to 15-20 campaigns would dramatically increase the platform's organizing capacity.

### 3.4 Candidate Trackers Are Incomplete

The Council Candidate Tracker covers only 2 of 13 districts (D2 and D6). All candidate responses are still pending ("Questionnaire Sent"). The Mayoral Tracker has detailed responses from one candidate (Lisa Calder&oacute;n) with the incumbent and others pending. These tools are valuable infrastructure for the 2027 election cycle but currently present as mostly empty.

**Risk:** Directing traffic to half-built tracker pages undermines credibility. Either accelerate response collection or gate the pages behind a "Coming Soon" state until content is ready.

### 3.5 Grant Proposals Are a Hidden Strength

The 6 federal grant templates are excellent — each properly references its corresponding policy page and provides complete project narratives for HUD, FEMA, NTIA, and DOT programs. This is a model for how tools should integrate with policies. However, these templates are not surfaced in the outreach playbook or communications strategy at all.

**Opportunity:** The existence of shovel-ready grant proposals is a powerful credibility signal. "We didn't just write a policy — we wrote the federal grant application" is a compelling talking point for media pitches, community org outreach, and candidate recruitment.

---

## 4. Outreach Material Currency

### 4.1 Stale Policy Counts

All outreach materials reference the original 25-policy platform:

| Document | Stale Reference | Current Reality |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| OUTREACH-PLAYBOOK.md | "40+ proposals" (Section 4 Reddit post) | 45 policies |
| OUTREACH-PLAYBOOK.md | References "25 policies" implicitly throughout | 45 policies + 8 tools |
| REDDIT-COMMENTS.md | No policy count mentioned | Should reference 45 |
| LEGISLATION-READY.md | "Which of our 25 proposals..." (line 3) | 45 proposals; Tier analysis covers only ~18 |
| About page | "We develop detailed, data-driven policy proposals" (no count) | Should state "45 policies" |
| Take-Action page | Lists 11 actions; no tool/policy count | Should reference "45 policies and 8 tools" |

### 4.2 Legislation-Ready Needs Expansion

The Legislation-Ready document analyzes ~18 proposals across 4 tiers. With 45 policies now on the platform, 27 policies have no legislative pathway analysis. New policies that particularly need this:

- **Autonomous Vehicles** (state preemption issues under Colorado SB 17-213)
- **Water Security** (Denver Water independent governance; state water law)
- **Reparations** (legal challenges — Evanston model already being litigated)
- **Public Banking** (federal/state bank charter requirements)
- **Guaranteed Income** (benefits cliff interactions with SSI/SSDI)
- **Fiscal Reform** (TABOR implications for every revenue proposal)

### 4.3 Outreach Playbook Doesn't Reference Tools

The Outreach Playbook (OUTREACH-PLAYBOOK.md) provides excellent channel strategies for Facebook, Nextdoor, Reddit, Spanish-language media, and op-eds. But it never references the 8 interactive tools as shareable assets. The eviction tracker, rent calculator, and sidewalk data explorer are exactly the kind of content that performs well on social media and in group chats — data people can interact with rather than policy documents they have to read.

**Recommendation:** Add a section to the playbook on sharing tools: "When someone in a Facebook group complains about a rent increase, link them to the rent calculator. When someone asks about evictions, link them to the eviction tracker. When someone complains about sidewalks, share the sidewalk data explorer."

### 4.4 Reddit Comments Reference Outdated Figures

REDDIT-COMMENTS.md (Comment 6) references Denver minimum wage as "$18.29" — this should be updated to $18.81 (2025). The rest of the comments appear current but should be reviewed for annual data refresh.

---

## 5. Messaging Gaps (Carried Forward)

Several messaging gaps from the original review remain partially or fully unresolved:

### 5.1 Audience-Specific Framing (ORIGINAL: Missing — CURRENT: Still Missing)

The platform still has a single tone across all 45 policies: morally clear, data-forward, somewhat academic. The outreach playbook provides channel-specific adaptations (Facebook vs. Reddit vs. Nextdoor) but not audience-specific message frames.

No policy has:
- A "moderate voter" version emphasizing fiscal responsibility and feasibility
- A "working-class voter" version emphasizing personal dollar-amount savings
- A "small business owner" version emphasizing competitive advantages

The Small Business policy itself does excellent work addressing business owner concerns, but the housing, wage, and healthcare policies do not frame their arguments in business-friendly terms.

### 5.2 Template Structure (ORIGINAL: Concern — CURRENT: Improved)

The original review flagged template fatigue across 25 identically structured policies. With 45 policies, the structure has actually diversified somewhat — newer policies include "Who Opposes This" sections, more detailed "What Denver Currently Does" analysis, and varied FAQ depth. However, the core structure (Problem → Current State → Solution → Evidence Table → Funding → FAQ) remains consistent. This is not necessarily a problem at 45 policies — consistency aids navigation. The original recommendation to lead with Denver resident stories for 3-4 flagship policies remains valid and unimplemented.

### 5.3 Contrast Messaging (ORIGINAL: Missing in Policies — CURRENT: Present in Outreach Only)

The outreach materials (REDDIT-COMMENTS.md, OUTREACH-PLAYBOOK.md) now contain strong contrast messaging: Lisa Calder&oacute;n's housing record, Mike Johnston's Flock Safety contract, developer subsidies vs. public housing costs, broadband inaction. The policy pages themselves remain contrast-free. This separation is defensible — policies are reference documents while outreach is persuasion — but means a reader who only visits the site never encounters the "why hasn't this happened?" framing that the outreach materials use so effectively.

---

## 6. Updated Priority Actions

### Tier 1: Fix Before Driving Traffic (1-2 weeks)

1. **Complete the anti-displacement policy** — file is truncated; needs full FAQ, references, evidence table, and funding section
2. **Add the 2 remaining missing FAQs:**
   - Social Housing: "Where will 10,000 units go? What about neighborhood opposition?"
   - Corporate Landlord Ban: "Won't forced divestiture cause a fire sale that crashes property values?"
3. **Strengthen rent control small landlord FAQ** — address mortgage burden and refinancing cycles specifically, not just "3% is sustainable"
4. **Fix Rent Calculator and Know Your Rights tool isolation** — add links to corresponding policy pages
5. **Update Reddit Comments minimum wage figure** — $18.29 → $18.81 (2025)
6. **Update all references from "25 policies" to "45 policies"** across LEGISLATION-READY.md, outreach materials, about page, and take-action page

### Tier 2: Before 2027 Election Cycle Ramp-Up (1-2 months)

7. **Expand Resistbot campaigns from 5 to 15-20** — prioritize medical debt, living wage, STAR expansion, broadband, and climate
8. **Add cross-linking between tools and policies** — each tool should link to its policy page and 1-2 related tools
9. **Add "Related Policies" sections** to each of the 45 policy pages (2-3 links per policy)
10. **Expand Legislation-Ready analysis** to cover all 45 policies (currently covers ~18)
11. **Beef up thin policies** — Community Land Trusts (2 FAQs), Gig Worker Protections (2 FAQs), and Public Banking (thin on regulatory pathway)
12. **Add "Who Opposes This" sections** to policies that lack them: Social Housing, Rent Control, Community Land Trusts, Housing First, Paid Leave, Education, Works Councils
13. **Complete candidate tracker coverage** — expand beyond 2 of 13 council districts; follow up on pending questionnaire responses
14. **Add tools to outreach playbook** — new section on sharing interactive tools in social media and group chats
15. **Surface grant proposals as credibility signal** — mention shovel-ready federal applications in op-ed strategy and community org outreach

### Tier 3: Strategic (3-6 months)

16. **Translate 5 flagship policies fully into Spanish** (Social Housing, Rent Control, Living Wage, Healthcare, Immigration Sanctuary) — this has been on the list since the original review and remains the largest equity gap
17. **Develop audience-specific message frames** for 5 flagship policies (moderate voter, working-class voter, small business owner versions)
18. **Add implementation pathway labels** to each policy (city ordinance / ballot measure / state legislation / federal)
19. **Build a "Platform & Tools" hub page** that explains how the 45 policies and 8 tools work together as a system
20. **Add 3-4 Denver resident stories** to flagship policy pages (first-person narratives, not just data)
21. **Create policy-to-tool mapping** so each policy page shows which tools help advance it
22. **Annual data refresh protocol** — quarterly review pass to update year-stamped statistics
