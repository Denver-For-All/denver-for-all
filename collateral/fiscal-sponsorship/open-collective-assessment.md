# Open Collective — Assessment & Implementation Guide

## Why Open Collective

Open Collective with Open Source Collective as fiscal host is the right fit for DenverForAll:

- **Setup in days**, not weeks or months
- **Public real-time ledger** — every dollar in, every dollar out, visible to anyone. This is the strongest trust signal you can offer Denver residents and council members.
- **10% fee** handled by the fiscal host (Open Source Collective)
- **No 501(c)(3) required** — OSC is a 501(c)(6) that handles legal/tax/compliance
- **No gatekeeping** — open to qualifying open-source projects
- **Donations are not tax-deductible** — and that's fine. Your donors are giving $10–50 to support open-source civic research, not looking for tax write-offs.

## Denver Legal Compliance

### Policy Research = Protected Civic Activity

DenverForAll publishes evidence-based policy research and suggests solutions. This is **issue advocacy and civic education**, not political campaigning:

- **Publishing research** (e.g., "rent stabilization would save the average Denver renter $2,400/year") = issue advocacy
- **Suggesting policy solutions** (e.g., "Denver should expand the STAR program to 24/7 coverage") = issue advocacy
- **Sharing research with council members and the mayor's office** = civic participation

### When It Would Become Regulated

- **Issue Committee status** ($500 threshold): Only triggered if you spend money or raise money _specifically to tell people how to vote_ on a ballot measure with express advocacy ("Vote YES on Measure X")
- **Lobbyist registration** (DRMC 2-301): Only required for _paid_ lobbyists. Volunteers sharing research with public officials fall under the Volunteer Exception.

DenverForAll does neither. Publishing research that others may use to inform ballot measures is not express advocacy — it's the research working as intended.

### Open Collective Strengthens Compliance

The public ledger actually makes compliance easier:

- Every dollar is documented — no risk of undisclosed expenditures
- If anyone questions spending, the full record is already public
- Demonstrates the project is funded by small grassroots donations, not dark money

## Fiscal Host: Open Source Collective

**Why OSC:**

- Purpose-built for open-source projects — DenverForAll's code, research, and tools are all open source and public domain
- 501(c)(6) trade association handling all tax/legal/compliance
- 10% fee on incoming funds
- No application fee, no monthly minimums
- Handles payouts, reimbursements, and tax receipts
- Hosts thousands of open-source projects

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create the Collective (Day 1)

1. Go to opencollective.com → Create a Collective
2. **Name:** "Denver For All"
3. Add description from the transparency statement, logo, link to denverforall.org
4. Set up the page with mission and what funds support

### Step 2: Apply to Open Source Collective as Fiscal Host (Day 1–3)

1. From your Collective page, apply to Open Source Collective
2. They verify your project is genuinely open source (public GitHub repo, public domain content)
3. Approval typically takes a few days
4. Once approved, you can accept donations immediately

### Step 3: Configure Donation Tiers in OpenCollective Dashboard

Create the following tiers in the OpenCollective dashboard under **Collective Settings → Tiers**. Each tier should include the name, amount, frequency, description, and (where noted) a fundraising goal.

#### One-Time Donation Tiers

| Name                 | Amount | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Goal |

| **City Changer**     | $500   | Reaches nearly 3% of Denver through Resistbot petitions on a specific policy issue. At $1 per 40 messages, $500 puts a targeted petition in front of ~20,000 residents — the threshold where turnout shifts policy outcomes. | —    |
| **Custom Amount**    | Any    | Every dollar counts. Even $5 funds real research that supports real policy change.                                                                                                                                           | —    |

#### Yearly Donation Tiers

#### Dashboard Configuration Notes

- **Default tier:** Set "Tenant Defender" ($25 one-time) as the default/highlighted tier — it maps to a tangible output (one full day of research) at an accessible price point
- **Custom amounts:** Enable custom amount donations with no minimum
- **Tier images:** Use policy-relevant Denver photos (skyline, neighborhoods, civic tools screenshots)
- **Goals:** Monthly tier goals are aspirational targets to show potential supporters how close the project is to sustainable recurring funding. 20 × $10 + 10 × $25 + 5 × $50 + 3 × $100 = $1,000/month, which exceeds the $200–800 operating range and provides a buffer for growth
- **Thank-you message:** Customize the post-donation message (see `fundraising/donation-page-copy.md` for copy)

### Step 4: Add to DenverForAll.org

- Add the transparency statement to the site (see `fundraising/transparency-statement.md`)
- Embed Open Collective donate widget on policy pages and the main site
- Add donate link to navigation

### Step 5: Submit Expenses with Receipts

Every expenditure goes through Open Collective with a receipt:

- Anthropic Claude API billing → screenshot/invoice
- Domain renewal → registrar receipt
- vAPI chatbot → monthly invoice
- Any data subscriptions → provider receipt

OSC reviews and pays/reimburses. Full record is public.

### Step 6: Promote

- Announce on newsletter, Reddit, social channels
- Include donate link in Resistbot campaigns and outreach
- Reference the public ledger in all communications — "see exactly where every dollar goes"
- Mention in outreach to council members and partners — transparency builds credibility
