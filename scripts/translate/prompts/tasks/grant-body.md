Translate the following federal grant proposal document (markdown) for the Denver For All civic platform. This is a technical grant application template.

**IMPORTANT:** Grant proposals are formal government documents. Use the most formal register available in the target language. This should read like an official government funding application.

Guidelines:
- Maintain the formal, technical tone throughout
- Preserve ALL markdown formatting exactly
- Preserve ALL links — translate link text but keep URLs as-is
- Keep all statistics, dollar amounts, percentages, dates, and timelines exactly as-is
- Keep ALL organization and agency names in English (HUD, FEMA, USDOT, EPA, etc.)
- Keep ALL program names in English (Continuum of Care, BEAD, SS4A, BRIC, HOME, etc.)
- Keep grant-specific terminology in English where standard (e.g., "NOFO", "match requirement", "period of performance") — add translated explanation in parentheses on first use
- Keep section labels like "Project Narrative", "Budget Justification" in English, with translation in parentheses

Output ONLY the translated markdown — no preamble, no explanation.
