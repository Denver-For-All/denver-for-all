## Fiscal Sponsorship (Accept Tax-Deductible Donations Without 501(c)(3))

A fiscal sponsor is a 501(c)(3) that legally receives tax-deductible donations on behalf of a project. This lets DenverForAll accept foundation grants and tax-deductible individual contributions without incorporating as a nonprofit.

### Tides Foundation (Recommended)
- **What:** One of the largest progressive fiscal sponsors; $1.4B+ in assets
- **Provides:** Grant management, HR, legal support
- **Fee:** ~9% of funds raised (varies by project size)
- **Why:** Maximum credibility with progressive foundations — many already flow money through Tides
- **Website:** [tides.org](https://www.tides.org/)

### Movement Strategy Center
- **What:** Incubates and accelerates transformative movements through fiscal sponsorship
- **Provides:** Strategic support alongside fiscal sponsorship — not just pass-through
- **Why:** More hands-on movement-building support than Tides
- **Website:** [movementstrategy.org/fiscal-sponsorship](https://movementstrategy.org/fiscal-sponsorship/)

### Social Good Fund
- **What:** Based in Richmond, CA; sponsors hundreds of social justice projects
- **Fee:** 5–10%
- **Best for:** Smaller organizations getting started
- **Website:** socialgoodfund.org

### Alliance for Global Justice (AFGJ) — Use Caution
- **What:** Offers fiscal sponsorship for grassroots projects
- **Warning:** PayPal, Stripe, and other payment processors have dropped AFGJ; Ford Foundation and Arnold Ventures pulled funding; Congressional scrutiny over lobbying disclosure
- **Risk:** Could create payment processing and reputational problems for DenverForAll

## Key Takeaway: Fiscal Sponsorship First

The single most impactful step is securing fiscal sponsorship (Tides or Movement Strategy Center). This unlocks:
- Tax-deductible individual donations via ActBlue/Givebutter
- Eligibility for every foundation grant listed above
- Credibility with progressive funders who already work through these sponsors
- Legal structure without the overhead of forming a 501(c)(3)

With fiscal sponsorship + a fundraising platform, DenverForAll's 600 weekly visitors become a direct funding pipeline. Even a modest 2% conversion rate at $25 average = ~$300/week in small-dollar donations, plus eligibility for $10K–$800K foundation grants.
