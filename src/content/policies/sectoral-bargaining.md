## The Problem

The American model of labor organizing - union elections at individual workplaces - is broken by design. Employers spend millions on union-busting. Even when workers win, they negotiate alone against corporate resources. And 94% of private sector workers have no union at all.

The result: wages have stagnated for 40 years while productivity and corporate profits have soared. The problem isn't that workers don't want unions - it's that the system is rigged against them.

### What Denver Currently Does

Denver has **no sectoral bargaining framework**. Colorado's union membership rate is approximately 7.2% (BLS, 2023), below the national average of 10%. Denver workers in hospitality, food service, and home care -- the sectors with the worst wages and conditions -- have near-zero collective bargaining coverage.

California's Fast Food Council (AB 1228, 2023) is the closest US precedent: a state-level wage board that set a $20/hr minimum for fast food workers. While it faced political challenges and was modified through compromise, it demonstrated that sectoral wage-setting is legally and practically feasible in the US context.

## Our Solution

### Denver Sectoral Wage Boards

**What is sectoral bargaining?** Instead of workers unionizing company by company, entire industries negotiate wages and conditions together. All restaurant workers in Denver covered by one agreement. All hotel workers by another. All home care workers by another.

This is how it works in Germany, Scandinavia, France, and most developed democracies. It's the single most effective labor policy tool available.

**Denver Wage Board Structure:**
- City council establishes Wage Boards for specific sectors (starting with: restaurants/food service, hotels/hospitality, home care/domestic work, rideshare/delivery)
- Each board includes: worker representatives, employer representatives, public members
- Boards set minimum standards for the sector: wages, scheduling, benefits, safety
- Standards apply to ALL employers in the sector within Denver - no competitive disadvantage for compliant businesses

**City Contractor Requirements:**
- All city contracts require participation in relevant sectoral bargaining agreements
- City contractors must pay prevailing sectoral wages (not just minimum wage)
- Benefits parity: health insurance, PTO, retirement contributions matching sectoral standards
- Labor peace agreements required for all city-contracted services

**Why this is more effective than traditional unionizing:**
- Covers ALL workers in a sector, not just those who successfully organized
- Removes the competitive race to the bottom - all businesses in a sector have the same labor costs
- Eliminates the employer incentive to bust individual unions
- Creates industry-wide standards that improve conditions for everyone

### International Evidence: The Dominant Model Worldwide

Sectoral bargaining is not experimental. It is the standard labor model in most wealthy democracies:

| Country | Model | Coverage | Result |
|---------|-------|----------|--------|
| **Germany** | Sector-wide *Tarifverträge* between employer associations and unions. Government can extend agreements to cover entire sectors. | ~50% directly, spillover raises most wages | Largest economy in Europe. Manufacturing powerhouse. Higher wages for comparable work than US. |
| **Sweden** | Centralized bargaining. No statutory minimum wage - sector agreements set floors. | 90%+ | Among lowest inequality in the world. Fast food workers earn $20+/hr with benefits. |
| **Denmark** | No minimum wage law. Sector agreements cover virtually all workers. "Flexicurity" pairs with generous unemployment. | 84% | McDonald's workers earn $22/hr with 6 weeks paid vacation. Lowest poverty in Europe. |
| **France** | Sector agreements extended by government to all workers in the sector, even non-union firms. | **98%** (highest in the world) | 8% union membership but 98% coverage. This is the model: low union density doesn't prevent broad coverage. |
| **Australia** | Fair Work Commission "Modern Awards" - tripartite body sets industry minimums. | Universal | Minimum wage ~$23 AUD/hr. 30 years without recession before COVID. |
| **New Zealand** | Reintroduced "Fair Pay Agreements" in 2022. | Growing | Direct response to enterprise-only bargaining driving up inequality. |

**The US enterprise-only model is the global outlier.** It produces the lowest union coverage, lowest wages relative to productivity, and highest inequality of any wealthy democracy.

**Key insight from France:** You don't need high union membership. France has 8% union membership but 98% bargaining coverage - because government extends negotiated agreements to entire sectors. Denver's wage boards replicate this: set standards for all employers regardless of unionization.

## How We Pay For It

This is a regulatory framework, not a spending program. Wage Board administration: $2-3M/year, funded by employer assessments proportional to sector size.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Can a city do this?"**
Yes. Several US cities and states have created sector-specific wage boards. California's Fast Food Council sets standards for all fast food workers statewide. New York has used wage boards for decades. Denver can do this for any industry within city limits.

**"Won't businesses relocate outside Denver?"**
Restaurants, hotels, and home care providers serve Denver customers in Denver. They can't relocate to Aurora and still serve downtown hotel guests. Location-dependent businesses can't flee - and the evidence from cities with higher labor standards shows they don't.

**"This sounds like socialism."**
It's how Germany works - a country with a stronger economy, lower unemployment, and a larger manufacturing sector than the US. It's how Scandinavia works - consistently ranked as the best places in the world to live and do business. Sectoral bargaining is mainstream economics everywhere except the US.

**"Doesn't federal labor law (NLRA) preempt city-level labor regulation?"**
The NLRA preempts laws that directly regulate the collective bargaining process between unions and employers. But wage boards are not collective bargaining -- they are government bodies setting minimum standards, similar to minimum wage laws. Cities and states have broad authority to set wage and working condition minimums. California's Fast Food Council, New York's wage boards, and numerous local prevailing wage laws all operate within NLRA parameters. The city contractor requirement is even clearer: Denver has unquestioned authority to set conditions for its own contracts.

## Who Opposes This (and Why)

- **National Restaurant Association** opposes any form of sectoral standard-setting.
- **Hotel and lodging industry** groups resist sector-wide labor standards.
- **Employer-side labor attorneys** argue NLRA preemption (addressed in FAQ).
