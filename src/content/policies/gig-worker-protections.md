## The Problem

Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart, and other gig platforms classify their workers as "independent contractors" to avoid paying minimum wage, overtime, benefits, workers' compensation, and payroll taxes. These companies set the prices, control the work, and can deactivate (fire) workers at will - but claim these workers are "their own bosses."

In Denver, thousands of gig workers earn below minimum wage after accounting for expenses (vehicle, gas, insurance, phone). They have no healthcare, no paid sick leave, no unemployment insurance, and no recourse when they're deactivated without explanation.

This is not innovation. It's wage theft at scale.

### What Denver/Colorado Currently Does

Colorado passed SB 22-161 in 2022, establishing minimum pay requirements for transportation network company (TNC) drivers (Uber/Lyft). The law requires a minimum per-mile and per-minute rate. However, it applies only to rideshare -- not to delivery workers (DoorDash, Instacart) or other gig platforms. It also does not reclassify workers as employees.

Nationally, there are an estimated 55-60 million gig workers (McKinsey Global Institute, 2022). Denver's gig workforce is estimated at 30,000-50,000 workers across rideshare, delivery, care work, and other platforms.

## Our Solution

### Denver Gig Worker Protection Act

**1. ABC Test for Employment Classification**
A worker is presumed to be an employee unless the hiring entity proves ALL three:
- (A) The worker is free from control and direction in performing the work
- (B) The work is outside the usual course of the hiring entity's business
- (C) The worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade of the same nature

Gig platform workers fail all three prongs - they are employees. This means they receive: minimum wage, overtime, workers' comp, paid sick leave, and unemployment insurance.

**2. Minimum Earnings Guarantee**
While classification challenges proceed through courts, immediate floor: gig workers must earn at least $25/hr (Denver minimum) for all active time, including time spent waiting for orders/rides. Expenses (mileage, vehicle wear, phone data) are reimbursed on top.

**3. Deactivation Protections**
- Written explanation required for any deactivation
- Right to appeal to an independent review board
- No deactivation based solely on algorithmic ratings
- Wrongful deactivation: reinstatement + back pay

**4. Data Transparency**
Platforms must provide workers with:
- Full breakdown of how pay is calculated for each job
- Data on all jobs offered and completed
- Algorithmic factors affecting job offers and deactivation
- Aggregate data on worker earnings (published quarterly)

**5. Portable Benefits**
Create a Denver Gig Worker Benefits Fund:
- Platforms contribute per-hour-worked into the fund
- Workers accrue benefits (health, retirement, PTO) across multiple platforms
- Benefits are portable - they follow the worker, not the platform

## How We Pay For It

Platforms pay. The entire gig economy business model is built on externalizing labor costs onto workers and taxpayers. When a DoorDash driver gets injured and goes to Denver Health without insurance, taxpayers pay. This policy makes the companies that profit from the work pay for the costs of the work.

### International Evidence: Gig Worker Protections

| Country | Model | Result |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **Spain** | *Ley Rider* (2021) - presumes all platform delivery workers are employees. Companies must disclose algorithms that affect working conditions. | Riders reclassified as employees with full labor rights. Platforms adapted their business models. Deliveries still arrive on time. |
| **United Kingdom** | Supreme Court ruled Uber drivers are "workers" (not independent contractors) entitled to minimum wage, holiday pay, and pension contributions. | Uber reclassified 70,000+ UK drivers as workers. Company is still operating and profitable. Workers earn more and have protections. |
| **France** | Platform workers have right to disconnect, accident insurance, and training. Recent court rulings have reclassified multiple platforms' workers as employees. | Incremental protections expanding. Courts consistently ruling that platform control = employment relationship. |
| **Netherlands** | Proposed legislation to presume employment relationship for platform workers. Uber and Deliveroo drivers ruled employees by courts. | Deliveroo exited the Dutch market rather than comply - and was immediately replaced by platforms willing to treat workers fairly. |
| **California, US** | AB5 (2019) codified ABC test for worker classification. Platforms spent $200M on Prop 22 to exempt themselves, but courts struck portions of Prop 22 as unconstitutional. | Despite corporate pushback, the principle that platform workers are employees continues to gain ground in courts and legislatures. |
| **European Union** | Platform Work Directive (2024) - EU-wide rules creating presumption of employment for platform workers. Algorithmic management transparency requirements. | 28 million platform workers across the EU gaining employment protections. The global consensus is moving toward classification as employees. |

**The global direction is unmistakable:** every major economy is moving toward recognizing gig workers as employees. The US is the holdout, and even here, California, New York, and multiple cities are leading the way. Denver should be next.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Won't this kill the gig economy?"**
The gig economy functions in California, which has similar protections (AB5). Uber and Lyft are still operating. The difference is workers earn more and have protections. If a business can only exist by misclassifying employees, it deserves to be disrupted - by labor law.

**"Some gig workers like being independent contractors."**
Some do. Those workers can still contract independently - they just have to pass the ABC test, meaning they're genuinely independent (set their own prices, work for multiple clients, have their own business). An Uber driver who can't set their fare is not independent.

**"What about gig workers who work across city lines?"**
Denver's ordinance applies to work performed within Denver city limits. For rideshare, the trip's origin determines jurisdiction (a ride starting in Denver is covered regardless of destination). For delivery, the delivery location determines jurisdiction. This is the same framework used for minimum wage enforcement and sales tax collection -- cities already manage cross-jurisdictional economic activity.

## Who Opposes This (and Why)

- **Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart** and other gig platforms spend hundreds of millions fighting worker classification (Uber/Lyft/DoorDash spent $200M on California's Prop 22 alone).
- **Platform lobbyists** argue that reclassification will destroy "flexibility" -- but the ABC test doesn't prevent flexible work, it just requires fair compensation.
