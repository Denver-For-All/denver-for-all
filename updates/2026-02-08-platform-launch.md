# 48 Policies, 11 Free Tools, and $0 in Corporate Money: Denver For All Is Live

We're excited to share what Denver For All has been building — and where we're headed.

## What We've Built

Denver For All is an open-source policy platform and organizing toolkit for economic justice in Denver. Everything is free, public, and built to put power back in the hands of working people.

Here's what's live right now:

**48 data-driven policy proposals** spanning housing, labor, health, climate, public safety, education, infrastructure, immigration, democracy, and more. Every proposal is backed by evidence, cites real-world case studies, and includes implementation details. These aren't wish lists — they're actionable blueprints.

**11 interactive tools** anyone can use today:

- **Eviction Tracker** — A live dashboard showing which landlords file the most evictions and which neighborhoods are hardest hit. 15,953 Denver families faced eviction filings last year — 72% above pre-pandemic levels.
- **Follow the Money** — See exactly who funds Denver City Council campaigns. Outside spending exploded 380% between 2019 and 2023. Now you can see where it goes.
- **Rent Control Calculator** — Enter your rent and see what you'd save under proposed rent stabilization. Generate a shareable graphic to spread the word.
- **Know Your Rights Chatbot** — A 24/7 AI-powered tenant rights assistant available in English and Spanish. Know your rights before your landlord tells you what they are.
- **Resistbot Campaigns** — Pre-written letters to elected officials at every level. Text SIGN to Resistbot and send yours in under two minutes.
- **2027 Candidate & Mayoral Trackers** — The same 10 questions sent to every candidate. Answers published unedited. No spin, no cherry-picking.

**Bilingual from day one** — All policy titles, summaries, and key tools are available in English and Spanish.

## How We Pay for This

Our total annual operating cost is **$310–840/year**. That's it. No office, no staff salaries, no consultants. We use free-tier infrastructure (Cloudflare Pages, Workers, and D1) and open-source tools.

We take **zero corporate money**. Every dollar comes from grassroots donors like you, right here on Open Collective with full transparency.

## What's Next

We're gearing up for the **2027 Denver municipal elections** — the biggest opportunity in years to elect a City Council and mayor who actually represent working people. Here's what's on the roadmap:

- Publishing grant proposal templates so community organizations can fund these policies
- Expanding candidate accountability tools as the 2027 race heats up
- Growing our volunteer base (we need translators, data analysts, designers, and writers)
- Building out the organizing infrastructure for district-level campaigns

## Get Involved

- **Contribute financially** — Even $5 keeps the lights on. Every dollar is public and accounted for.
- **Volunteer your skills** — Join our Signal group or reach out if you can translate, analyze data, design, or write.
- **Use the tools** — Run your rent through the calculator. Look up your landlord on the eviction tracker. Send a letter through Resistbot.
- **Fork the code** — Everything is open source and MIT-licensed. If you're in another city, take what we've built and make it yours.

This is what grassroots organizing looks like when you build it in the open. No gatekeepers, no corporate sponsors, no barriers.

Let's get to work.
