## The Problem

Denver's annual budget exceeds $1.6 billion. Residents have almost no say in how it's spent. City Council holds public hearings that few attend, and the mayor's office drives priorities. The result: budgets reflect the interests of developers, lobbyists, and politically connected groups — not ordinary Denver residents.

Meanwhile, trust in local government is low and declining. People feel — correctly — that their voice doesn't matter. Voter turnout in Denver municipal elections is often below 30%. The system is technically democratic but functionally unresponsive.

## Our Solution

### 1. Participatory Budgeting (PB)

Pioneered in Porto Alegre, Brazil in 1989 and now used in over 7,000 cities worldwide. Residents directly decide how public money is spent.

**Denver's PB Program:**
- **10% of the city's capital budget** (~$100-150M/year) is allocated through participatory budgeting
- **Every Denver resident** 14+ can participate (including non-citizens — you don't need to be a voter to have a say in your neighborhood)
- **Neighborhood assemblies** propose projects: parks, street improvements, community centers, safety infrastructure, environmental remediation
- **Resident vote** selects winning projects — online + in-person, with multilingual ballots
- **Budget delegates** (elected from neighborhoods) develop proposals into implementable projects with city staff support

**Process (annual cycle):**
1. **Idea collection** (2 months): Neighborhood assemblies generate proposals
2. **Development** (3 months): Budget delegates work with city engineers and planners to develop proposals into costed, feasible projects
3. **Exhibition** (1 month): All proposals displayed publicly, online and at community locations
4. **Vote** (2 weeks): All residents vote on final projects
5. **Implementation** (ongoing): City implements winning projects with public tracking dashboard

### 2. Citizens' Assemblies

Adapted from Ireland's Citizens' Assembly model, which resolved the country's most contentious issues (abortion, marriage equality, climate) through democratic deliberation rather than partisan warfare.

**How it works:**
- **Randomly selected** residents (like jury duty, but for policy)
- **Demographically representative**: assembly mirrors Denver's population by age, race, income, neighborhood, gender
- **Professional facilitation**: independent facilitators, not politicians
- **Expert testimony**: assembly hears from researchers, affected communities, practitioners
- **Deliberation**: weeks of structured discussion, learning, and debate
- **Recommendations**: assembly produces detailed policy recommendations that city council must publicly respond to (accept, modify with explanation, or reject with explanation)

**Denver Citizens' Assembly topics (proposed first 3 years):**
- Year 1: Housing affordability and homelessness
- Year 2: Police and public safety
- Year 3: Climate and environmental justice

## The Evidence: This Works

### Participatory Budgeting

| City | Scale | Result |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Porto Alegre, Brazil** | Pioneered PB in 1989, 50,000+ participants/year | Infant mortality dropped 50%. Water access reached 98%. Dramatic improvements in low-income neighborhoods. Became model for the world. |
| **Paris, France** | €500M allocated through PB (2014-2020), 5% of total budget | 300+ projects completed. 10% of residents participate annually. Projects include parks, bike lanes, green spaces, community gardens. |
| **Helsinki, Finland** | €8.8M PB budget (growing annually) | High participation, innovative proposals, increased trust in government |
| **New York City** | Largest PB program in US. $40M+/year across 30+ districts. | 100,000+ residents participate. Projects in every borough. Youth participation especially high. |
| **Madrid, Spain** | €100M PB budget via "Decide Madrid" digital platform | 400,000+ online participants. Proposals include social housing, green infrastructure, public transit. |

**Consistent findings across all PB programs:**
- Money flows to previously neglected neighborhoods
- Infrastructure improves faster in low-income areas
- Civic engagement increases (especially among youth, immigrants, and low-income residents)
- Trust in government increases measurably
- Spending is more efficient (residents know what their neighborhoods need)

### Citizens' Assemblies

| Country | Issue | Result |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **Ireland** | Abortion legalization (2016-2017) | Citizens' Assembly recommended legalization → referendum passed with 66% support. Resolved decades-long deadlock. |
| **Ireland** | Marriage equality (2013-2014) | Constitutional Convention (similar model) recommended → referendum passed with 62% support. |
| **France** | Climate policy (2019-2020) | 150 randomly selected citizens produced 149 climate recommendations. Several became law. |
| **UK** | Climate policy (2020) | Climate Assembly UK produced detailed recommendations on reaching net zero. |
| **Belgium** | Permanent citizens' assembly in German-speaking community | Ongoing deliberative body that regularly produces policy recommendations. |

**Why random selection works better than elections:**
- Elected officials are disproportionately wealthy, male, white, and older than their constituents
- Random selection produces assemblies that actually look like the population
- Participants don't owe donors or lobbyists anything
- Deliberation (hearing evidence, discussing with peers) produces better-informed decisions than campaign soundbites

## How We Pay For It

- **Participatory budgeting administration:** $2-3M/year (0.15% of the budget being allocated)
- **Citizens' assemblies:** $1-2M per assembly (participant stipends, facilitation, expert testimony, venue)
- **Total:** $4-5M/year for dramatically improved democratic participation

This is a rounding error in a $1.6B budget — and the evidence shows PB produces more efficient spending than bureaucratic allocation.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Ordinary people can't make budget decisions."**
They make them better than you'd expect. Porto Alegre's PB program produced more equitable infrastructure than decades of expert-driven budgeting. And citizens' assemblies consistently produce well-reasoned, evidence-based recommendations — because participants actually listen to evidence, unlike most politicians.

**"This will slow down government."**
The PB cycle runs parallel to the regular budget process. Citizens' assemblies are convened for specific questions on specific timelines. Neither replaces existing governance — they supplement it with democratic legitimacy.

**"What about people who don't participate?"**
More people participate in PB than vote in municipal elections. And the random selection for citizens' assemblies ensures representation even without self-selection. These tools reach people that elections don't.

**"Won't this be captured by special interests?"**
Harder to capture than elections. PB uses one-person-one-vote (no campaign donations). Citizens' assemblies use random selection (no lobbying). Both are structurally more resistant to special interest capture than the current system.
