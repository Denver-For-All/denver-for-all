## The Problem

Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart, and other gig platforms classify their workers as "independent contractors" to avoid paying minimum wage, overtime, benefits, workers' compensation, and payroll taxes. These companies set the prices, control the work, and can deactivate (fire) workers at will — but claim these workers are "their own bosses."

In Denver, thousands of gig workers earn below minimum wage after accounting for expenses (vehicle, gas, insurance, phone). They have no healthcare, no paid sick leave, no unemployment insurance, and no recourse when they're deactivated without explanation.

This is not innovation. It's wage theft at scale.

## Our Solution

### Denver Gig Worker Protection Act

**1. ABC Test for Employment Classification**
A worker is presumed to be an employee unless the hiring entity proves ALL three:
- (A) The worker is free from control and direction in performing the work
- (B) The work is outside the usual course of the hiring entity's business
- (C) The worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade of the same nature

Gig platform workers fail all three prongs — they are employees. This means they receive: minimum wage, overtime, workers' comp, paid sick leave, and unemployment insurance.

**2. Minimum Earnings Guarantee**
While classification challenges proceed through courts, immediate floor: gig workers must earn at least $25/hr (Denver minimum) for all active time, including time spent waiting for orders/rides. Expenses (mileage, vehicle wear, phone data) are reimbursed on top.

**3. Deactivation Protections**
- Written explanation required for any deactivation
- Right to appeal to an independent review board
- No deactivation based solely on algorithmic ratings
- Wrongful deactivation: reinstatement + back pay

**4. Data Transparency**
Platforms must provide workers with:
- Full breakdown of how pay is calculated for each job
- Data on all jobs offered and completed
- Algorithmic factors affecting job offers and deactivation
- Aggregate data on worker earnings (published quarterly)

**5. Portable Benefits**
Create a Denver Gig Worker Benefits Fund:
- Platforms contribute per-hour-worked into the fund
- Workers accrue benefits (health, retirement, PTO) across multiple platforms
- Benefits are portable — they follow the worker, not the platform

## How We Pay For It

Platforms pay. The entire gig economy business model is built on externalizing labor costs onto workers and taxpayers. When a DoorDash driver gets injured and goes to Denver Health without insurance, taxpayers pay. This policy makes the companies that profit from the work pay for the costs of the work.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Won't this kill the gig economy?"**
The gig economy functions in California, which has similar protections (AB5). Uber and Lyft are still operating. The difference is workers earn more and have protections. If a business can only exist by misclassifying employees, it deserves to be disrupted — by labor law.

**"Some gig workers like being independent contractors."**
Some do. Those workers can still contract independently — they just have to pass the ABC test, meaning they're genuinely independent (set their own prices, work for multiple clients, have their own business). An Uber driver who can't set their fare is not independent.
